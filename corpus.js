    "body": "Finding Fido, the Canadian Federation of Humane Society\u2019s campaign to inform people about the hazards of puppy mills and how to avoid them, is in its second successful year, according to program director; Shelagh McDonald. \r\rThe campaign is an online website that targets potential dog buyers and highlights information about how to identify unethical dog-breeders and sellers, which sometimes run large-scale operations known as puppy mills. It\u2019s the lack of knowledge about puppy mills that leads people to them in the first place, says McDonald, and Finding Fido seeks to provide a resource to educate people about making responsible decisions when it comes to buying a dog.\u201cThere are too many people who don\u2019t know at all how to recognize good sources or bad sources for buying a dog,\u201d she says. McDonald explains that puppy mills are dog breeders whose goal is to produce as many puppies at the lowest cost possible. According to her, most of these dogs live in \u201chorrendous conditions,\u201d usually barns with very little ventilation, they\u2019re not fed properly, and they don\u2019t have veterinary care.Dr. Shelley Hutchings, a veterinarian with the Ottawa Humane Society, says that common infectious diseases found in dogs from puppy mills include intestinal and external parasites, as well as kennel cough, while common behavioural problems found in these dogs stem from poor socialization. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a huge welfare impact on the dogs kept in those conditions,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cAnd people who buy them are buying puppies that are physically unhealthy and most often have behavioural issues because they have not lived any kind of normal life at all.\u201dMcDonald said that while the cost for buying puppies from puppy mills is usually lower than elsewhere, the costs for veterinary care usually ends up being significant. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0According to her, while there\u2019s a lot more awareness out there about puppy mills, people still don\u2019t know how to recognize them. Miriam Smith, OHS\u2019s rescue and investigation inspector, offers some helpful tips in recognizing puppy mills. She says that those who don\u2019t give full disclosure of where the puppies and parents live, those that sell puppies out of the back of a vehicle, those that provide a sad story to go along with it, those that don\u2019t disclose any information about the seller or the breeder for \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cprivacy\u201d reasons, are most likely involved in puppy mills. But there is also findingfido.ca. The website is full of information about puppy mills, and valuable resources for locating ethical breeders. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s three parts to (the website),\u201d McDonald explains, \u201cThe first is: Are you ready for a dog? . . . If so, how do you choose the right one? . . . And the last step: Where to find it.\u201d Both CFHS and OHS said that if you suspect someone to be involved in a puppy mill operation, contact your local police service.

Jordan, Alex Russell, Michael Kelly, Ashley Hinshaw.Comfortable behind the lens, Andrew continues filming as his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) drives him to school, telling him about a party that evening and warning him not to bring his camera.But Andrew brings the camera, either prizing the feeling of objective distance it gives him or simply wanting to chronicle his incipient social life along with his dad\u2019s abuse and the decline of his cancer-stricken mother. A few hours later, he is exploring a strange cave with Matt and destined student body president Steve Montgomery (The Wire\u2019s Michael B. Jordan), their school\u2019s golden child. Matt asks whether anyone else knows about Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave, and suddenly the trio discover a giant crystal glowing auspiciously with the unmistakable light of a plot device. Cut to black, and Andrew, Matt and Steve are playing baseball \u2013 but when they hurl balls at one another\u2019s faces, the balls curve through the air or hover in place. Deducing that their newfound telekinesis operates like a muscle, with nosebleeds signalling overuse, they proceed to \u201cwork out\u201d their abilities via pranks on classmates and strangers.Though billed as a mash-up between the found-footage and superhero genres, Chronicle is properly neither, imbuing its protagonists with superhuman abilities but foregoing the whole heroic alpha male shtick in order to demonstrate its characters\u2019 differences in outlook and their consequences.And those consequences are commensurate with their growing powers.At first, it\u2019s disciplining an overly aggressive driver with a shockwave that nearly kills him in driving him off the road \u2013 prompting Matt to conceive of rules (no using their power in public or against living creatures, for instance). As their abilities develop, their pranks and quarrels and wrongdoings become amplified and, eventually, very dangerous.The tone first-time director Josh Trank lends to the story further belies the superhero comparison. Self-aware but not smart-alecky, and with a deadly earnest dark streak, Chronicle has more in common with Vincenzo Natali\u2019s grim Splice than with Sam Raimi\u2019s wise-cracking Spider-Man.As Andrew\u2019s telekinesis outstrips that of his friends, he discovers that his father no longer poses any threat to him, which frees him not only of his fears but his inhibitions along with them. He can crush a car like a soda can. He can take a spider apart in mid-air the way Dr. Manhattan did a tank in Watchmen. He begins to consider himself an \u201capex predator.\u201dLynne Ramsay\u2019s We Need to Talk About Kevin was a more thorough and more deliberate study in the makings of a sociopath, but Chronicle has its own ideas about loner kids and potential mental illness. And though it explores them with teen-action-movie blinders on, even that much is progress for the genre.Trank likewise puts a new spin on the found footage gimmick, occasionally switching feeds from Andrew\u2019s camera to that of Casey (Ashley Hinshaw), the school\u2019s token gorgeous video blogger and Matt\u2019s hopeless crush, for a literal second viewpoint.But when it all hits the fan and snippets from arbitrary police and security cameras feed inexplicably into the movie, the conceit collapses (either that or it becomes a stream-of-consciousness narrative from the perspective of Eagle Eye\u2019s malevolent A.I.). Chronicle seems to miss the point of the found footage style when it releases itself from the confines of Andrew and Casey\u2019s cameras \u2013 only to try and climb right back in for a loftily sappy ending.As with Attack the Block, when a neophyte director and a cast of unknowns put together something that compares favourably to the standard Hollywood blockbuster \u2013 and Chronicle\u2019s budget was a mere $12 million \u2013 it deserves notice.Dane DeHaan is superlative in the lead role, resembling a young Leonardo DiCaprio in acting chops as well as in appearance, and Jordan \u2013 who deserves more time on screen \u2013 impresses as Steve. With Russell they capture teenage male group dynamics taken to the umpteenth degree, and it is quite a ride.",

It takes place during the aforementioned art auction, attended by the cream of Ottawa high society, following on the heels of the unsolved murder of private eye Lou Sweeney and the theft of the Pekinese Peregrine, an infamous Chinese artefact said to carry with it a powerful curse. Naturally, this being an Eddie May Mystery, the sparkling evening quickly dissolves into murder and mayhem.\u2028For those unfamiliar with Eddie May Mysteries and, more generally, dinner theatre, The Curse of the Pekinese Peregrine is hardly your grandmother\u2019s stuffy theatre experience. The Pekinese Peregrine\u2019s eclectic cast of characters \u2013 including the likes of sexy chanteuse Birdie LaChance (Dana Cryderman), her mustachioed stalker (Joey Pyro, played by Nick Amott), various security personnel and Eddie May (Ray Besharah) himself \u2013 regularly step off of Scarlett\u2019s elevated stage to mingle with the dining audience, discussing the auction and theorizing who amongst them could be responsible for the evening\u2019s macabre turn of events. \u2028\u2028As the night progresses and both the bodies and clues accumulate, the audience is invited to leave their tables in order to examine bags of evidence, eventually taking a stab at correctly identifying the murderer themselves.\u2028Directed by Zach Counsil, who doesn\u2019t shy away from the use of special effects \u2013 from clever strobe lighting to copious amounts of fake blood \u2013 or the occasional song-and-dance number, Pekinese Peregrine is thoroughly entertaining. While the spot-on physicality of Nick Amott and Richard G\u00e9linas (playing a rough-and-tumble security agent) stood out during Saturday\u2019s performance, the entire cast did a phenomenal job of improvising with the audience and played out staged scenes with energy and a clear sense of play. Also of note are Jody Haucke\u2019s accurate period costumes, David Magladry\u2019s wild lighting and Steven Lafond and Allan Gauthier\u2019s cinematic music (though the cast was sometimes drowned out by the powerful speaker system used to play it).\u2028Add to that mix an impressive three-course dinner (salad, entr\u00e9e, dessert \u2013 might I recommend the BBQ chicken?), and I\u2019d say you\u2019ve got yourself a great alternative to the dinner-and-a-movie clich\u00e9. \u2028The Curse of the Pekinese Peregrine plays at Scarlett\u2019s Dinner Theatre at 62 York Street every Saturday night through the spring of 2012.

However, it is responsible for site restoration fees after each festival.For example, when festival tents are erected and over half a million people use NCC land in the span of two weeks, the grass needs to be replaced, said Wolff.Luxton says those costs are usually between $4,000 to $8,000 dollars, but last year the festival was back-charged $44,282 in restoration fees.Wolff said NCC workers have met with the festival organizers before, during set-up and after past events to discuss ways to mitigate these costs.\u00a0 Luxton says the festival\u2019s budget is approximately $2 million. In the past the festival has hosted events at Major\u2019s Hill Park and Commissioner\u2019s Park and around Dow\u2019s Lake where the tulips bloom. One million tulips are already in the ground and set to bloom on NCC land this spring.\u201cThis will carry on,\u201d said Wolff. \u201cThe tulips are an attraction. The festival was built because of the tulips.\u201d\u2028Representatives of the Canadian Tulip Festival could not be reached for comment.\u2028While business improvement associations around the city have expressed interest in working with the festival, the NCC said this move does not pose a significant revenue loss for them.\u00a0 \u201cWithout the tulips there would be no reason for a festival, and without programming there would be no festival and the City would not see the same economic benefit,\u201d said Luxton. The festivals final programming lineup will be released around the end of the month. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the tulip festival. In 1945, the Dutch government sent 100,000 tulip bulbs to Canada as appreciation for Canada\u2019s role in liberating Holland and providing refuge for the Dutch royal family during the Second World War.The festival grew out of that gift and, until now, has been held at the NCC parks.",

It will also fix any roads and sidewalks that are in poor condition, although the city scrapped its plans to widen the traffic-plagued road at the end of January because it would have been too difficult to move Bronson\u2019s hydro installations.

The new rules prohibit smoking on all municipal properties, including parks and beaches, as well as restaurant and bar patios.However, the new rules don\u2019t include properties under the National Capital Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. As the NCC has no smoking restrictions on its properties, this means that some parks and other recreational areas, such as along the Rideau Canal and the Ottawa River, won\u2019t be covered by the new bylaw. In Centretown, for example, this means that Confederation Park will be exempt from the new rules, while, a few blocks south, Minto Park will be smoke-free. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t like not knowing where I can smoke up,\u201d complained Jenna Bourbonnais, a young woman who says she spends a lot of time in Confederation Park. Matt Walker, a visitor from Saskatchewan, agrees that the discrepancy might cause problems. \u201cIt would be bad to see someone get a ticket just because they didn\u2019t know which park they could smoke at,\u201d says Walker. But others thought the new rules weren\u2019t that confusing at all.\u201cIt seems pretty clear to me,\u201d says Erin Kells, who is a non-smoker. \u201cI\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be that hard to figure out.

However, the loophole may not last long, although the NCC seems in no hurry to follow suit. It says it may follow the city\u2019s example only after monitoring the success of the new regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s far too premature to talk about specifics,\u201d says NCC media relations officer Jasmine Leduc. \u201cThe NCC has been notified of the city increasing the number of smoke-free areas and is supportive of its public health objectives and will be watching the initiative closely as it progresses towards implementation.\u201dLeduc says the NCC needs to study many aspects of a potential smoking ban before it decides whether or not to implement a similar strategy.\u201cWe\u2019d have to look at the regulations itself and the legal implications of that. We\u2019d need to look at the types of events where it would apply, how would we enforce it, and other details.\u201dBut some Ottawa events hosted on NCC property, such as Bluesfest on LeBreton Flats, may be subject to a smoking ban sooner than the NCCs parks.\u201cWell, the NCC is considering a signed agreement between the city to work towards creating a smoke-free environment at some of these festivals,\u201d says Somerset Ward Coun. Diane Holmes, chair of the Ottawa Board of Health.The NCC says it supports the city\u2019s steps towards a smoke-free environment. While the NCC itself has no public health mandate, it has worked with the city before on a number of initiatives.While NCC parks will remain smoke-friendly for the time being, the smoking ban will come into effect on city properties on July 2.

It promotes walking, bicycling and urban parks and paths as a way to fulfill this goal.Its current project received two-year funding from the Ontario government in the summer of 2011 and will be working with the eight chosen sites for six months this year.Munroe says these six months will focus on community engagement and meeting with various stakeholders to assess the current challenges facing the area and what the community would like to see improved.The organization will meet with seniors in the area, youth, local businesses and city staff to get their expertise.Munroe emphasizes the idea of the project as a way to represent the entire community\u2019s desires equally. The idea of creating cities for everyone \u2013 young and old \u2013 is something she says she finds people have responded well to and have connected with.\u201cWe do feel we\u2019ve been trapped in cities that are great for 30-year-old athletic people and not cities that are great for people with all abilities,\u201d Munroe says.Another concept that made Dundonald Park an attractive choice for the project was the possible partnership with the nearby Centretown Community Health Centre. Christina Marchant, director of community health promotion and early years at the health centre, says the CCHC been working to make better use of Dundonald Park for a year now and are seeing an increased community appetite in using the park.The centre brought in walking groups, meditation clubs and Tai Chi events, all in an attempt to create a more inviting and accessible atmosphere within the park.\u201cWe noticed that the more we were there, the more people were interested in playing, engaging and talking with us. That was the first step,\u201d Marchant says.Still, Marchant says despite the allure of the park, it\u2019s seen as one of the most dangerous in the area. It has been an appealing hang out for those wishing to drink and smoke in the past.Nick Giardini, a University of Ottawa student who lives near the park, says he began to feel unsafe when noticing loud individuals and homeless people drinking on the park benches. Despite the safety problems, he says he thinks the park holds promise.\u201cIt has a certain edgy flair that I find attractive. If there were more of a community presence, I would absolutely spend more time there,\u201d Giardini says.",

The goal was to use local knowledge to come up with concrete ideas that would create a vibrant, sustainable capital for all Canadians. Ideas ranged from creating more space for First Nations on Victoria Island, to investing in \u201csmall gestures,\u201d such as the red Muskoka chairs which were set out last summer in front of the National War Memorial, overlooking the canal. People also spoke about the need to showcase Ottawa\u2019s water front and link communities together such as Lower Town with Elgin Street. \u00a0\u201cCanadians really do care about their capital,\u201d said Marie Lemay, the CEO of the NCC during the meeting. \u201cThe experience was absolutely rewarding and the generosity of Canadians and their interest in the capital is inspiring.\u201dThe NCC published its cross-country findings on Jan. 25 in a report called Horizon 2067: Plan for Canada\u2019s Capital. The project is expected to help Ottawa become a world-class city in time to celebrate Canada\u2019s bicentennial anniversary in 2067. It will also replace the original city plan that gave birth to a modern Ottawa in the 1950s. \u00a0\u201cTo have this kind of input is crucial to the future of Ottawa,\u201d said Derek James, a workshop participant at the Museum of Nature. \u201cYou\u2019re talking 50 years down the road.

    "body": "A cell phone can provide children with a measure of security by connecting them with their parents, but it can also expose them to the dangers of cyberbullying, harassment and child pornography, says Const. Amy Haggerty of the Ottawa police. \r\rBecause of a growing trend called sexting, children as young as 10 years old are increasingly sending explicit text messages and nude photos of themselves between camera phones and other mobile devices. However, parents who purchase cell phones for their children in an effort to ensure their safety may be unaware of the dangers that cell phones can pose, says Matt Ertele, a student at Lisgar Collegiate Institute.\u00a0\u201cParents want to feel that their kids are safe so they start giving them cell phones around Grade 7,\u201d he says.But rather than using their phones to contact their parents, Ertele says most students use their phones to text their friends.Increasingly, these text messages are becoming sexual in nature and Haggerty says that half of all teenagers have received sexually explicit texts.Even though all Ottawa public schools have rules prohibiting the use of cell phones during class, this doesn\u2019t stop students from using their mobile devices to spread rumours outside of school.This can cause students who sext to become the targets of ridicule, harassment and non-stop cyberbullying from peers if their nude pictures and sexual messages circulate on the web and in schools, says Haggerty.\u00a0\u201cSometimes, when boyfriends and girlfriends break-up, their messages start to go viral around the school when one upset person starts spreading private text messages from their former partner to all of their friends,\u201d says Lauren Mills, another student at Lisgar.Mills estimates that up to 90 per cent of students have cell phones, meaning messages can reach a large audience very quickly.\u201cThirty years ago, we wrote little notes to our friends and passed them around in class,\u201d says Lisgar vice-principal Bruce Summers.\u201cToday, advances in technology and the availability of cell phones allow messages to be shared constantly and somewhat uncontrollably with a larger and sometimes unintended audience.\u201dHaggerty describes this as a \u201cspider web effect,\u201d where a message or photo sent to five friends may get forwarded to five others and so on, in some cases reaching hundreds or thousands of recipients.What may start out as playful behaviour between romantic couples can quickly turn into both a criminal and social nightmare for the 20 per cent of teenagers who have sent nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves, says Haggerty. \u00a0\u201cIf there is a picture of a nude person under the age of 18, it can be considered child pornography,\u201d she says.Laurel Gordon, who also attends Lisgar, says that part of the problem may be caused by students who get cell phones when they are too young and don\u2019t fully understand the dangers of technology. \u00a0\u201cThere are definitely girls in Grade 5 who have iPhones and Blackberries and more technology than they know what to do with,\u201d she says.To combat the growing trend of sexting, school resource officers from the Ottawa police will be attending high schools throughout the spring to educate students about the safe use of technology.",

    "body": "In the wake of several high-profile teen suicides, the Ontario government is drafting anti-bullying legislation that would require schools to crack down on the behaviour.\r\rBut it seems that many Canadians don\u2019t believe that suspension or expulsion is enough.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A recent online survey by Angus Reid Public Opinion found that 65 per cent of the 1,006 respondents want bullying criminalized. Nine in 10 Canadians want cyber bullying laws enacted in their province. But is this the right approach?Bullying certainly is harmful behaviour and who hasn\u2019t felt its sting during their childhood? But, for the extreme cases when principals, teachers and parents are inadequate to handle the behaviour, there already are laws in place that can be applied to bullies, such as assault. To try and criminalize such an umbrella of behaviour is dangerous and, frankly, unnecessary. \u00a0First, how do we define bullying? The spectrum of severity can run from not getting an invitation to a birthday party to physical abuse and daily torment. Each situation and child is different. Decisions about the gravity of the behavior and the appropriate punishment should be made on a case-by-case basis. If the treatment warrants legal action, there are already the appropriate laws in place. Ontario\u2019s legislation should prompt teachers and school officials to be more attentive and watchful for bullying and by labeling such an ill-defined and complex behaviour as illegal, it may make it easier for school officials to remove themselves from the situation, leaving it up to \u201clegal officials.\u201d Criminalizing bullying would shift the onus from institutions, such as schools and the family, to an impersonal body. Internet and cell phones do complicate methods of bullying, and in many cases, make it easier; there is now a sphere beyond the classroom, playground and neighbourhood park where watchful eyes can\u2019t always go. However, it can perhaps encourage parents to be more vigilant in monitoring their children\u2019s use of these technologies. There should certainly be protocols in schools for reprimanding students that harass or abuse others on the Internet. An Internet policy between parents, school officials and students could be organized and implemented, but to make all negative behaviour on the Internet illegal is crossing the line. There are also important lessons to be learned from bullying. Kids are cruel, but so is life.\u00a0 Children need to learn how to stand up to others, how to deal with criticism \u2013 warranted or not \u2013 and how to seek help when injustices occur. Bullying continues past high school: into relationships, marriages, university lecture halls and the workplace.\u00a0 \u00a0Humans are not born socially adept or empathetic; it is a learned behaviour. Unfortunately, discovering conflict resolution, compassion and self-confidence can be a painful learning curve. There are undoubtedly times when the \u201csticks-and-stones\u201d lesson is taken to an unhealthy level. But there are already legal measures in place for those situations. Otherwise, let parents, teachers and the kids themselves work together to offer support to work through the difficult years of \u201cgrowing-up.\u201d",

    "body": "When the front door is locked, try the back door. That\u2019s what a Conservative backbencher is trying to do in an effort to criminalize abortion, but unfortunately for Stephen Woodworth, he will be thwarted by women\u2019s human rights.\r\rIn 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down anti-abortion laws, arguing that they areunconstitutional and violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms by barring women from their right to life, liberty and security.But now, Woodworth has proposed a private member\u2019s motion to create a parliamentary committee to debate whether or not a fetus is a legal person. The motion is expected to come up for debate in late March.Declaring a fetus a legal person grants it the fundamental rights protected by the charter. This includes the right to life and therefore abortion would constitute murder. The committee would be composed of 12 members of Parliament. Woodworth says medical experts would come and \u201ctestify with evidence to inform them of the details and the reality\u201d of life before birth.Currently in Canada, an individual becomes a legal person when he or she exits the birth canal and can breathe independently.Woodworth says the proposed committee would present its findings to Parliament, at which time it could affirm, amend or replace the definition of when life begins.Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said he will not reopen the abortion debate, but that does not stop Conservative MPs from doing it for him.The anti-choice movement argues that fetuses must have legal rights because their life begins before birth. However, Canadians must refuse to accept this for important reasons. To deny women access to abortion violates their right to security of the person, including the rights to privacy of the body and its health.Anti-choice legislation would directly police women\u2019s bodies and limit women\u2019s freedom. So what are women supposed to do if they\u2019re forced to have children? Among other things, that would increase pressure on existing childcare services. Canada would have to put more money into child protective and children\u2019s aid services to deal with the influx of about 100,000 children per year that would enter the system as a result of unwanted pregnancies.This creates a dilemma: on the one hand, granting legal rights to fetuses suggests they are subject to rights that the government must uphold. On the other hand, the government is forcing people to give birth even if they can't provide for the children.Furthermore, if this motion is passed and the committee grants fetuses legal rights, pregnant women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths could be held criminally responsible. What about women with drug addictions? Or women who have no education or come from low-income families and cannot provide the healthiest possible pregnancy?\u201cMedicine is not governed by criminal law,\u201d says Joyce Arthur, executive director of the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. \u201cPregnancy is a health condition and taking a legal approach to it is the wrong approach.\u201d Woodworth says that \u201cmedical science\u201d would prove a fetus is a complete person. He refers to fetuses as unborn children or human beings. The language Woodworth uses neglects the fact that the fetus is not an individual, but an entity completely dependent on a woman\u2019s body, says Arthur.Until it is born, \u201ca fetus is part of a woman\u2019s body and cannot be granted separate rights,\u201d says Agathe Gramet-Kedzior, acting executive director of Canadians for Choice, a non-profit organization that provides education and research about reproductive services.There are many misconceptions about abortion, including the notion that they are routinely performed up until the ninth month.Abortions are legal in Canada up until 20 weeks. After that point, it is up to the discretion of a medical professional and the woman to make a decision in an emergency situation. These circumstances include when the mother\u2019s life is at risk, or if the fetus is determined to be in such a state that it would not survive after birth.The number of abortions that occur after 20 weeks is tiny because of these extreme circumstances, says Arthur.Perhaps Woodworth is right, in one sense. We do need to reopen this debate. But not for the reasons he is suggesting. The proposed committee would have the power to acknowledge and rectify the inadequate access to abortion and reproductive services in Canada. For women living in major cities, there is generally a good level of access to clinics or hospitals. For women in rural areas, Conservative provinces, or Northern Canada, the number of abortion providers is limited or nonexistent, violating women\u2019s right to reproductive health care.Women in New Brunswick need two doctor\u2019s references to have an abortion, which are only available at two hospitals and one clinic. Prince Edward Island does not have any abortion clinics. They will fund the procedure, but patients must pay for the travel costs to another location. This is a major issue, as young or poor women may not be able to afford to travel elsewhere.Accessibility issues lead women to take drastic measures, such as throwing themselves down the stairs or undergoing \u201cback alley\u201d procedures, putting them at great risk for physical harm, or even death.If this motion is passed, it is hoped the committee would continue to protect women\u2019s fundamental freedoms by reaffirming pro-choice legislation across the board instead of taking back women\u2019s bodily rights.",

It also provides clean equipment necessary for injecting the drugs like syringes, filters and cookers. One of the main benefits of the site is that there have been no lethal overdoses on location. According to Vancouver Coastal Health statistics, in 2010 alone there were 221 overdoses, but no fatalities.\u202fDespite this obvious benefit, many are opposed to the idea of safe injection sites. In 2006 the Canadian Police Association unanimously voted down the idea. As well, former Ottawa Police Chief Vern White and Mayor Jim Watson have vocally opposed opening an Insite centre in the city.\u202fIf Insite does save lives, why is it the wrong option for Ottawa?Having an Insite centre in Ottawa would be detrimental to whichever community it is placed in. The selected area would become a hotbed for addicts and for crimes often associated with drug addiction. The centre does not provide drugs, therefore addicts would still need to illegally purchase the drugs. This would concentrate crime.Ottawa has worked hard to clean up communities such as Vanier. Why would any community want a centre like Insite to bring down property values and deter visitors from the area? Also, taxpayer dollars should not be spent to facilitate people\u2019s drug use. Addiction is a serious illness and money should not be spent to feed it. Per year, the operating budget for Vancouver\u2019s Insite is about $3 million.\u202fThat money could be going towards drug education, prevention and treatment. Yes, it may seem harsh to put property values and tax dollars above human life. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Ottawa should do nothing to help addicts. There are other options besides a permanent safe injection site.Ottawa can develop mobile sites for safe injection. These mobile units are already in place for needle exchange programs in the city. As well, Montreal\u2019s public health department has recommended a mobile safe injection unit for its city.\u202fThe mobile units can make stops at locations around Ottawa so that people can use drugs safely. The units can follow a schedule and have a phone number to be reached at. They should also continue to serve as a needle exchange program.These mobile units would be less expensive than a permanent site and would not concentrate the problems associated with drug use. They could also provide information packages about where to get help. Mobile units are not the ideal remedy and would not be able to serve as many people as a permanent site would. However, there is no perfect solution. Drug use is going on and cannot be ignored.The mobile unit is a good compromise between a permanent site and no site at all. It can help addicts while still protecting neighbourhoods and using health care money responsibly. ",

Once he learned how to process his own film, James Hare could never go back to handing off control of the final step in printing his photographs.\r\r\u201cI like the idea of having my hand in the photograph, having that handmade element to it,\u201d says Hare. \u201cDigital is essentially all machine-made, which makes it feel more removed from the artist.\u201dBut accessing wet lab photo processing facilities in downtown Ottawa is next to impossible for those who aren\u2019t enrolled in training programs such as those offered at the School of Photographic Arts Ottawa. Many end up using their kitchen sinks and bathtubs to develop their film.As a result, Hare is searching for space in Centretown to set up a community darkroom. The darkroom would serve photographers and filmmakers who have shunned the digital age and opt to use the traditional techniques of analog film.Hare, who does freelance photography, is looking for a space ranging between 108 to 180 square metres. Half the area would function as a darkroom and the other half as a finishing area where people could cut mats and mount their work.He has already viewed light industrial space down the street from the Enriched Bread Artists on Gladstone Avenue and is also looking into whether local churches might have space available for lease.He says membership fees would cover the cost of renting the space, but photographers would have to supply their own processing chemicals. The fees would also cover the cost of the plumbing supplies, used kitchen counters and sheets of plywood needed to set up the darkroom.\u201cWe\u2019re looking not necessarily to generate profit, but I think we\u2019d have enough interest to keep it open and running,\u201d Hare says.Hare\u2019s endeavour has so far piqued the interest of 30 people, many of whom are currently developing their film in less than ideal conditions.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m working out of my bathroom,\u201d says Jeremie Roy with a chuckle.Roy, who co-ordinates the part-time studies program at the School of Photographic Arts Ottawa, says the school could also use the new darkroom space to accommodate a growing interest in analog photography.\u201cDigital photography is so popular right now that we get students who come to us wanting to be different somehow,\u201d he says. \u201cSo younger generations are coming back to analog photography.\u201dAs a result, the school\u2019s darkroom is constantly in use and students regularly complain that the space is not available when they need it. The demand Roy sees on a daily basis at the school leads him to believe a community darkroom is a viable business model, even though film photography has lost some ground in the digital revolution. Most recently, venerable Eastman Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection, a result of the company\u2019s failure to commercialize its digital camera.\u201cAnalog is a different form of expression,\u201d Roy says. \u201cI don\u2019t think chemical photography will ever disappear, just in the same way that oil paint never disappeared even though acrylic paint makes a whole lot more sense.\u201d Ming Wu, a local photographer, works mainly with digital photography but sees the virtue in going back to basics.\u201cI rarely do film photography, but when I do, I pay a high price to have it developed,\u201d he says.Wu says he would be ready to pay a yearly membership fee of around $100 to access a darkroom facility.Hare, however, is hoping to reduce membership costs by getting funding from either the city or a patron willing to support a community arts organization.\u201cWe\u2019re still exploring the options and looking at whether it\u2019s realistic, but we\u2019re keeping our fingers crossed.\u201d",

Although the community generally splits itself by genre, there is still a sense of togetherness among the jazz, rock, folk and blues communities as they push for recognition in Ottawa and beyond.\r\rBe that as it may, musicians in Ottawa rarely get the attention they deserve. Those\u00a0 closely involved with the Ottawa music community and have seen this first-hand: talented bands and solo-artists who work for years to create a local following with little to show for it despite their hard work and dedication to their craft.Bluesfest is the biggest venue in the city for Ottawa\u2019s musicians. As festival organizers prepare to announce their line-up for this year\u2019s festival, many people are wondering who the headliners will be this year. From Kiss to Kanye and Skrillex to The Black Keys, the organizers always manage to pull in big-name acts. But what about the little guys?The deadline for local artist submissions was Jan. 30 and applications are now closed for the 2012 festival, which runs from July 4-15 at LeBreton Flats.Artists from outside the Ottawa-Gatineau region are not allowed to submit applications, which is a definite advantage for the locals. However, local artists are often just used to simply fill the roster and festival organizers do little to promote them.Selected artists are given the worst time slots, right at the start of the day. That means 6 p.m. on weeknights and noon on weekends during the festival. Often there is only a small crowd in the vast fields at the park, most of them parked on lawn chairs marking their territory for when the park fills up later on. Local bands are also relegated to side stages, or the Barney Danson Theatre in the National War Museum.The museum theatre is nice with plush, stadium seating. It\u2019s dark and cool, but there are only usually a handful of people in there at a given time. Of those, most are friends and family of the artists. The remainder are generally people looking to get out of the all-consuming, July heat and into the refreshing cool in the air conditioned theatre. There were a few bands that managed to play bigger stages last year, but this is an exception to the rule.The Murder Plans brought their brand brooding, bombastic rock and roll to the Hard Rock Cafe stage, while the Jesse Greene Band brought down the house with their heavy, soulful blues tunes at another secondary stage. Giant Hand, fronted by Kirk Ramsay, played the main stage. However he was scheduled right at the start of the day.There are many potential reasons why this trend continues year after year, but it may simply come down to marketability and revenue. When you consider it a bit more closely, local artists just don\u2019t draw that many customers. Fewer customer means fewer beers purchased and less merchandise sold and when you\u2019re running a multi-million dollar festival, profit has a lot to do with every aspect of the event.Still, there\u2019s something amiss here though. Bluesfest prides itself on being the biggest and best music series in Ottawa. It\u2019s the event that allows the city to show its cool side and help shed its reputation as the city that fun forgot.In all fairness, Bluesfest does all of this really well. Its reputation for bringing in the best and brightest stars of music is indisputable. But why not use some of that influence to up the profile of home-grown talent?Bluesfest should be paying its success forward to local musicians. And, who knows, the fest might just showcase the next major Canadian artist before they make it big. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s always cool.",

When Holly Golightly \u2013 heroine of the iconic film Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s \u2013 checks the time on the watch of a man causing him to tip Champagne into a woman\u2019s burning hairpiece while she declares, \u201cIt\u2019s 6:45!\u201d, rest assured it is 6:45 in the theatre as well.Despite the challenge of using thousands of clips spanning from one second to 30 seconds, the movie has a smooth flow, says filmgoer Kelly Montgomery. \u201cIt is interesting how he linked the scenes so you would have one guy go in the door and it would close with a different guy,\u201d she says.Montgomery was there with friends Laurence Lue and Kari Sattler, all of whom say they had not heard of the film before and it took them a while to realize the real time aspect. Once it dawned, they say it made the movie even more appealing. \u201cIt is crazy how much work and research must have gone into it,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cBecause they are such short scenes it keeps you engaged,\u201d adds Lue.Montgomery says she recognized a lot of the movies and enjoyed trying to guess what film each clip was taken from. From the chuckles in the theatre when certain clips came on, it is clear the audience was enjoying this as well.Even if you are not a huge film buff the odds of you spotting a film you know are pretty high. The pool of movies the maker draws from spans from early black and white to the modern flicks of today.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how prevalent clocks are in movies,\u201d Montgomery says. This is something Jonathan Shaughnessy, assistant curator of Contemporary Art at the National Gallery, says makes the piece so unique.\u201cIt is a profoundly moving experience to realize you are watching a visual and material manifestation of this abstract concept that governs our lives which is time,\u201d he says.Shaughnessy was in London, UK for the premier of the piece last year. \u201cWhen I saw it I was really moved by the fact that what starts as a pretty simple conceptual idea, \u2018can you make a functioning clock out of film footage,\u2019 becomes this really evocative kind of meditation on time.\u201dWork began soon after for the National Gallery to acquire the piece and on Feb. 10 this year. The Clock made its Canadian debut at the gallery.Shaughnessy says feedback has been nothing but positive. \u201cIt is the kind of work that if you haven\u2019t seen it and you read a description you might wonder, \u2018Okay, what is that all about,\u2019 but when you see it you get it.\u00a0\u201cYou realize after you have watched it for an hour or two or eight that you are watching nothing except for time passing but it is very entertaining,\u201d he says.The Clock, Shaughnessy points out, is not just a film, it is an art installation. \u201cThat is something that the artist Christian Marclay stipulates,\u201d he says, \u201cIt is meant for galleries, it is an installation and it is an experience.\u00a0\u201cWhen you are sitting there immersed in the gallery, in the experience of the whole artwork, you realize basically in the modern and contemporary age film has defined time for us in many ways.\u201dImportant to note is the time of day you see it. Shaughnessy explains that if you want to see how life is portrayed at three in the morning with all its insomnia, dream sequences and murders, you have to go see it at three in the morning. \u201cThe sun rising at 6 a.m., at 6 a.m., is quite something,\u201d he adds.The Clock runs at the National Gallery this March and is free with the cost of admission to the gallery. There is a 24-hour viewing every Thursday beginning at 10 a.m.",

The veteran guitarist has two Juno nominations in the blues album category.\r\rTony Diteodoro received his first Juno nominations for his band MonkeyJunk\u2019s second album, To Behold, and his contribution to Susie Vinnick\u2019s album, Me \u2018n\u2019 Mabel. The 49-year-old grew up in Centretown and has been respected in Ottawa\u2019s blues community since he was a teen.Ottawa is hosting the Juno Awards on April 1 at Scotiabank Place to celebrate the best in Canadian music. MonkeyJunk will perform at Irene\u2019s in the Glebe on March 30 for JunoFest, a multi-venue showcase of Juno nominated artists. Diteodoro will lead workshops at the Ottawa Folklore Centre on Bank Street where he has been teaching guitar for seven years and began taking lessons himself 33 years ago.\u201cI\u2019ve always loved the music school here because it is accomplished and produces many great musicians in Canada,\u201d he says. The avid musician teaches in a studio in the basement of the centre. The beige walls are lined with posters from blues music competitions and concerts. \u201cIt was a great time to promote the city\u2019s local talent for the upcoming Juno Awards,\u201d says Alan Marsden, director of the Ottawa Folklore Centre School of Music. The workshop will be 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. each Saturday from March 24 to April 14 at a cost of $30 per session. It will discuss the stylings of musicians Magic Sam, Jimmy Rogers and blues legend Freddie King.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because four years ago we were playing at Irene\u2019s, a bar where we would pass around a tip jar because we didn\u2019t get paid,\u201d Diteodoro says while strumming his guitar. MonkeyJunk is made up of Diteodoro, harmonica player and lead-vocalist Stephen Marriner and drummer Matthew Sobb. The band is known for having no bass player, giving the group a soulful sound, says Diteodoro.The band got its first break in Memphis at the 2009 International Blues Competition where it placed third out of 100 groups. This helped them land their first\u00a0 record deal The band has won a total of 12 Maple Blues Awards, Canada\u2019s national blues awards program.\u201cThe whole experience has been surreal,\u201d says lead-vocalist Marriner. \u201cI was in Barbados when I found out about the Juno nomination and I immediately cracked open a bottle of champagne and went down to the beach.\u201dArthur McGregor, owner of the Ottawa Folklore Centre, says it\u2019s no surprise MonkeyJunk is nominated for a Juno.\u201cThe band isn\u2019t one of your down-and-out blues types, it\u2019s an uptown kind-of-together band that\u2019s playing music because they love every minute of it,\u201d he says.\u00a0",

It airs on Mondays on OutTV, a specialty gay and lesbian television network.Before she went on stage last month, Jade London said she was extremely nervous.After about a minute in front of the crowd, she relaxed, danced, lip-synced and wowed the audience and judges.London took the drag queen title and a pink flamingo prize home from the competition.\u00a0Each contestant performed two numbers during the night and the five judges rated their performances. American drag queen Manila Luzon, who placed second in the last season of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, was a guest judge. Luzon also performed her single, \u201cHot Couture.\u201d By day, London is an unnamed make-up artist and hair stylist, but transforms when dressed up as London. \u201cThe main goal for drag is erasing everything about you and creating something different,\u201d London says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m dressed up, I\u2019m Jade London.\u201d London says she is \u201ca little more fierce\u201d than her\u00a0 shy and conservative day-to-day identity. London transformed into Beyonc\u00e9 for her first number, complete with a long blonde wig and dramatic makeup. After being asked to be a back-up dancer for drag queen Robin de Cradle at Capital Pride in 2008, London began creating her persona. Getting into drag was \u201ckind of an accident,\u201d London says.A 20-year veteran queen, Dixie Landers, says she fell into it too. Friends in Halifax dared Landers to dress up for a contest and if she won it, she\u2019d win the bet. \u201cIt was purely financial,\u201d she says with a smile.Landers, involved in Ottawa\u2019s drag scene for 12 years, now says there is \u201ca lot of new blood\" participating in the drag superstar competition.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy life is all about entertainment,\u201d London says. Born and raised in Ottawa, singing and dancing were always important in her life. London says she has plans to \u201cbuild an empire\u201d that includes music and fashion. She says she has worked to set a \u201creally, really high\u201d standard for queens in Ottawa. She has even recorded a song called \"Go Away\", a remake of the song by South Korean pop band 2NE1 and has plans to shoot a music video in the spring. Often drag queens only lip sync, so this makes her unique, London says.With this win, London says she will have the chance to network with people involved in the drag scene in New York Ciy. ",

The Ottawa Police Service opened dialogue last October at a Let\u2019s Chat Youth Caf\u00e9 when they hosted more than a hundred youth who contributed ideas on preventing crime and building stronger trust with police officers. The ideas helped organizers draft plans for the youth committee, intended to become a permanent sounding board on police issues.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a city-wide conversation, that gives youth an opportunity to be a resource and make a contribution,\u201d says Ripley. People under 24 can apply online before March 23. The Ottawa Police Service will choose up to 20 people to sit on the committee, along with three police members.Those selected will give four to five hours of their time a month. In return, they get a forum to voice their opinions and will be rewarded with leadership opportunities, free food and bus tickets.Allison McCartney, 20, an international development and globalization studies student at the University of Ottawa, says she is applying to the committee to learn about law and enforcement.\u201cI find it really interesting to be aware of the law and new changes that are affecting you,\u201d she says.The committee will also work to educate police officers, who will get a chance to learn about youth culture, trends and social media directly from its young members.\u00a0\u201cWe wanted to help give a voice to a segment of society that maybe doesn\u2019t traditionally have a voice,\u201d says Ottawa police Sgt. Jamie Dunlop.Dunlop says the committee was created to open a dialogue with youth, and not to address any particular problems.He says the committee could help raise awareness about bylaws that aren\u2019t readily known to youth, such as a ban on being in parks after 11 p.m. \u201cYouth could address if that\u2019s still a problem, or if there\u2019s different ways of dealing with it,\u201d Dunlop says.McCartney says the committee can also help educate youth who are not always aware of age specific rules, such as a zero tolerance law on blood alcohol concentration in drivers under 21.\u201cKnowledge isn\u2019t getting transferred. Sometimes I\u2019m not always aware of the separate rules for young people,\u201d McCartney says.McCartney is also interested in what measures the police are taking to increase security for young females at night.\u201cI want to see what precautions the police are taking to protect people such as myself, who are often on campus or taking the bus home late night,\u201d she says.The committee will be led by youth representing different areas of the city. The first meeting will be held at the Elgin Street police headquarters, and further meetings are likely to be held in different locations across the city.With a number of university students living in Centretown, the committee will help engage different sectors of the community, says Robert Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association.\u201cThis is a great way of developing more community leaders,\u201d Dekker says.",

As Jason Iddison says, sometimes all it takes to make a small difference in someone\u2019s life is a bowl of hot soup. \r\rFor the past four years, Iddison has been running the Bannock Bus, a mobile delivery service that provides homeless people hot meals with a distinctly aboriginal flavour. From Monday to Friday, the three-man team of Iddison, Tony Tulugak and Karl Richards cook up batches of stew, sometimes made with game meat such as venison or buffalo. They also bake bannock, a floury bread that is a staple of the traditional aboriginal diet. Then they bundle all the day\u2019s food into the trunk of a black Dodge Grand Caravan and deliver it to homeless people around the city. Based at the Odawa Native Friendship Centre on Stirling Avenue, the Bannock Bus has been travelling around Centretown and other parts of the downtown core since 2004. \u201cIf we have an outreach service that serves traditional, culturally relevant food and assistance, it\u2019s almost a no-brainer why Aboriginal people would be more comfortable dealing with us,\u201d says Iddison, as he spoons up a savoury bowl of sausage and potato stew. \u201cIt\u2019s very welcoming, and it\u2019s a piece of home on the street.\u201d According to local homelessness advocacy groups, 25 to 30 per cent of Ottawa\u2019s homeless population is aboriginal. Iddison says the higher proportion of aboriginal homeless people is one reason why it\u2019s important to have a culturally focused outreach service. He estimates they serve about 30 people a day. But the Bannock Bus welcomes anyone in need, regardless of ethnicity. \u201cHunger doesn\u2019t know colour,\u201d says Iddison. \u201cOur medicine wheel is inclusive \u2013 all races, all seasons. If we refuse to feed someone because of race, that\u2019s wrong. That would be against everything the medicine wheel teaches us.\u201d A man in his 50s named Randy met up with the Bannock Bus at the intersection of Elgin and Lewis. He started coming out last fall. \u201cI don\u2019t like going to all the (other soup) kitchens...sometimes you\u2019re just not comfortable with crowds of people, so it\u2019s a nice service to come up here,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the soup is awesome!\u201d Tulugak says these kinds of connections are what make his job worthwhile. He recalled one December night two years ago, when he met a man who had been sleeping in a park. \u201cHe broke his leg, so he couldn\u2019t work anymore. He lost his house and couldn\u2019t make money,\u201d says Tulugak, who gave the man a cup of coffee and a pamphlet listing local shelters and food banks. \u201cThat really choked me up when I saw tears coming out of his eyes and a smile.\u201d But on the other hand, Iddison says the most difficult part of his job is learning that someone in his community has died, which happens most often in winter. \u201cYou know part of their story, and maybe stood elbow to elbow with them when they were struggling to help themselves, and for one day, for them to just not be there, that\u2019s hard,\u201d he says. What comforts Iddison and Tulugak is knowing they can provide practical help, even though they say there are times when they wonder whether it\u2019s enough. \u201cI\u2019ve come to accept that I do all I can,\u201d says Iddison. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve found peace there.\u201d ",

For those trying to balance their budget, paying off a mortgage or their credit card debt can leave them feeling stretched for cash.\r\rBut Jacqueline Richards\u2019 financial philosophy maintains that some kinds of stretching can be good for finances.The mortgage agent, yoga teacher and self-proclaimed \u201cfinancial wellness coach\u201d is teaching an approach to money influenced by the principles of yoga.Richards\u2019 concept started when her yoga students started asking for financial advice.\u201cIf they\u2019re bursting into tears talking about a mortgage, then we\u2019re talking about more than just money here,\u201d she says. \u201cMoney has such an impact on their personal life.\u201dRichards says yoga, with its emphasis on reaching mental calm through physical postures, values balance \u2013 and not only the kind found by standing on one foot. \u201cBalance could be your credit score or your bank balance or it could be your chakra energy,\u201d she says, referring to the yogic concept of life force. The point, she adds, is that your physical and mental health can affect your financial health, and vice versa.So when Richards teaches workshops on mortgage payments or credit \u2013 often at Centretown\u2019s James Street Wellness Centre \u2013 she interrupts her speech with demonstrations of yoga poses.\u201cIf we can strengthen the body and the mind, then maybe we\u2019ll be in a better place to strengthen our approach to money,\u201d she says.Her clients are often more comfortable standing in tree pose than grappling with total debt service ratio, so Richards brings in yogic analogies to help. For example, she associates the ability to budget responsibly with a type of chakra linked to groundedness. In her book, Yoga for your Personal Finance, budgeting worksheets appear beside specific poses for re-balancing energy. Looking at finances from the yoga mat might be unusual, but Michael Moreau, an Ottawa-based financial planner, says the idea is practical from a business standpoint.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing new with that approach,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to market yourself in a way that makes sense to your clients.\u201dMoreau himself uses exercise analogies to break down financial jargon. \u201cYou want to optimize your financial fitness,\u201d he says. \u201cI think people can relate to that.\u201d The majority of Richards\u2019 clients are women (\u201cMore women do yoga,\u201d she says), and Moreau thinks that female clients are after a wider, more interconnected method to managing money.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that throughout my career \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing this for 22 years \u2013 that women want a broader, more experiential approach. It affects all parts of their life,\u201d he says.Michael Kelly is not Richards\u2019 typical client. The Ottawa entrepreneur prefers hockey to yoga, and admits he\u2019s outnumbered by women when he attends Richards\u2019 workshops, but he appreciates her approach because it\u2019s \u201ctangible.\u201d\u201cI like the kinetic part,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes she\u2019ll show a yoga move, which may seem crazy, but it connects with what she\u2019s talking about.\u201dThe movement in her workshops also keeps people from dozing off, which can be a hazard in finance education seminars, he says.For Kelly, Richards\u2019 style offers a connection to the material that is missing from more traditional approaches.\u201cKinesthetic learning \u2013 it\u2019s a formal learning technique that helps a lot of people,\u201d he says.On Richards\u2019 voicemail recording, she tells the listener, \u201cYou are absolutely wealthier than you think.\u201d That notion may not apply to everyone, but Ottawans seem willing to flex their financial muscles inside the yoga studio. Richards says interest \u201ccontinues to rise, because people want to have a different conversation about money.\u201d",

    "body": "In sports, teams sometimes take on new names, colours and uniforms to draw attendance and boost revenue.\r\rThis past off-season, the Toronto Blue Jays paid homage to their teams of the early \u201890s by reverting back to a vintage-inspired logo and colour scheme.These business-related moves seldom translate to success and, almost always, the teams that spend money on improving the product on the field, court or rink see the best results.Recently, Ottawa\u2019s headquarters for high-tech nurturing and development did both.The city rebranded the Ottawa Centre for Regional Innovation (OCRI) as Invest Ottawa. The centre \u2013 said to be the flagship of Mayor Jim Watson\u2019s $5.5-million commitment to economic development \u2013 was also given more money with the goal of making the nation\u2019s capital the best place in Canada to start and grow a knowledge-based business.While the name change and reconstructed mandate will draw attention to the centre, it will take more than a name to entice venture capitalists to invest in the city\u2019s businesses.Invest Ottawa stands to benefit more from its increased funding and the resulting resources than a new image.Although the centre is heralding a brand-new mandate, the new initiatives sound awfully familiar.The most obvious change is the name, which is more concise and addresses the task at hand. This strategy has been tried before. The name change is the second in as many years, after the organization made the slight change from the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation. Evidently, that banner didn't cut it. It would be shocking if investors obeyed the punchier and more directive name.Another change is the centre\u2019s mandate, which is aimed at training the city\u2019s entrepreneurs and attracting business in key sectors.The website does a poor job of explaining how Invest Ottawa differs from OCRI. It mentions that the centre\u2019s top three priorities are entrepreneurial development, foreign direct investment and business retention and expansion.The centre\u2019s website points out that, as OCRI, the organization modified its mandate several times. Even though the new mandate has a broader entrepreneurial focus, Invest Ottawa\u2019s fundamental goals seem very similar to OCRI\u2019s. The fostering of business growth and innovation still remains the overarching focus.The organization\u2019s initial goal was to connect Ottawa schools with the city\u2019s blossoming high-tech sector. Invest Ottawa\u2019s new mandate aims to \u201cwork closely with students at Ottawa universities and colleges to encourage them to stay in Ottawa to start their own companies or discover job opportunities at existing companies.\u201d It sounds like Invest Ottawa is going back to the future.One of the mandate\u2019s wrinkles that might spark some economic diversification is a new initiative to grow non-traditional Ottawa sectors like digital media, green energy film and TV.Ottawa\u2019s high-tech sector has been in its twilight for the better part of a decade. A push to branch out into other sectors seems behind schedule. However, it is the most innovative modification to the mandate, and is the kind of expansion that could spark some fresh interest in the business community.Hopefully, investors will take notice and recognize Ottawa\u2019s diversified economy and high quality of life.But if they do, it won\u2019t be because of another new name or overdue mandate, it will be because the city has done some savvy investing in itself.",

But since then, the majority of business groups are on the fence about officially joining the union.Erin Kelly, director of the Ottawa Chamber of Commerce, says BIAs that drop out of GOBIA aren\u2019t protecting their own interests. Rather, the choice not to participate puts the groups in a position where city hall won\u2019t deal with them at all, she says.\u201cThe city isn\u2019t going to meet with all 17 BIAs individually,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say I only care about my street but there are a lot of special interest groups and the more specialized and smaller they are, the harder it is to be heard.\u201d Fang says her BIA will most likely continue to throw GOBIA to the wayside in order to focus on individual concerns. \u201cGOBIA just hasn\u2019t been a priority,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t see that changing because I don\u2019t really see how it would help us.\u201dThe Chinatown BIA joins the Preston Street BIA among Centretown-based BIAs, in rejecting membership in GOBIA.As reported in the last issue of Centretown News, the Preston Street board decided in January not to take part in the project after learning it would have to get input from all GOBIA business groups and voice all concerns through the organization.Fang recognizes competition between business groups as they try to attract people to their areas. This conflict may lead to disagreements over union policies and the unfair treatment of some BIAs, particularly the smaller ones with a \u201clittle voice,\u201d she says. Kelly says although it may be hard for business groups to collaborate, they need to recognize the value of coming together. Agreeing on widespread priorities will lead to much more sway at city hall, she says.\u201cIt\u2019s more time, it\u2019s more effort, but it\u2019s also more effective,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to do the tough stuff in order to be heard.\u201dJocelyne Turner, a spokesperson for the City of Ottawa, says the city isn\u2019t involved in the development of GOBIA.\u00a0Even though the city initiated the process, the official establishment of GOBIA is in the hands of the individual BIAs, she says.Executive directors from the Bank Street Promenade, Somerset Village, and Sparks Street BIAs were unavailable for comment, according to spokespeople from the business groups.According to an informal survey of the other 12 business groups located outside of Centretown, Bells Corner and Wellington West support the initiative, Carp Road Corridor has chosen not to engage, four were undecided, and five were unavailable for comment.Christine Leadman, executive director of the Glebe BIA, says 10 of 17 BIA executive members attended the GOBIA meeting in January and only about four BIAs are definitely \u201con board\u201d with the initiative. There is still no set date for the union\u2019s formation. Meanwhile, the remaining members have discussed and drafted a constitution and agreed upon committees and an executive board.Leadman says even though there has been some progress at recent GOBIA meetings, the formation is far from complete.\u00a0\u201cAt present, I don\u2019t think a lot of the boards have been convinced they see the benefit.\u201d",

For most Canadians, ping-pong is not much more than a game casually played in a basement at a party. But for four athletes training in Centretown, table tennis has become a full-time job. \r\rThe best table tennis players from across the country train every day in a small office building gym on Louisa Street at the National Table Tennis Training Centre.These days, the competition has been amped up as four male athletes are locked in rigorous training for the next six weeks as they prepare for the North American Table Tennis Olympic Trials in North Carolina on April 20-22. The top three finishers will earn a berth in the 2012 Olympic Games in London. \u201cIt\u2019s really competitive. It\u2019s full time table tennis right now,\u201d says Olympic hopeful Andre Ho, a 19-year-old who gave up university to train six days a week in preparation for the Olympics. Players call the training centre a necessary step in improving the quality and popularity of table tennis in Canada. Players from across the country can receive partial government funding to live in Ottawa and train at the gym.Canada did not have a place to train fulltime before the last Olympic qualifiers. Head coach Duan Yongjun says this made it hard for athletes to improve. \u201cWe had to play in schools or community centres. We had strange schedules and sometimes didn\u2019t have access to facilities,\u201d he says.\u201d But now, in preparation for the trials, table tennis players have 24-hour access to a gym with about 10 tables and about a dozen fitness machines.They practice two times a day during the week, and hold one practice each weekend.Yongjun says the biggest benefit is players being able to work out strategy by playing against each other.\u201cThere are a lot of different tactics \u2013 spins, serves, hits \u2013 so many things to work out.

    "body": "To say Jeremy Lin\u2019s rise to stardom has been remarkable would be an enormous understatement. \r\rWithin days, the New York Knicks\u2019 backup point guard emerged from the bench and became the most prominent athlete in pro sports. Lin rallied the slumping Knicks to seven straight victories and scored more points in his first five NBA starts than any other player in history. It\u2019s like the Tim Tebow story all over again. Both players put struggling teams on their backs and, despite being the heavy underdogs, they found a way to win. One can\u2019t help but think divine intervention had something to do with it, considering Lin and Tebow are both devout Christians.Miracle or not, Lin\u2019s success has given everyone a place to turn after Tebow\u2019s Broncos were eliminated from the NFL playoffs. If you thought everyone was tired of relentless media hype surrounding a religious underdog athlete finding success, you were wrong. The world has gone absolutely bananas for Lin and the media have proven once again that they will stretch this great, inspiring story into anything they can as long as it\u2019s a moneymaker, even if it loses sight of Lin\u2019s achievements. First came the bizarre array of Lin puns, as the linderella story spread through social media at a rapid pace to a lincredible amount of people. The hype was linvincable and in no time, Lin became the flavour of the month. When the linsanity arrived in Canada, five games into his epic run, Lin buried a game-winning three pointer against the Toronto Raptors with less than a second remaining, sending the crowd into utter chaos.Everyone wants a piece of Jeremy Lin. In a mere matter of days, his jersey became the NBA\u2019s top seller, Nike released his own line of shoes, Ben and Jerry\u2019s named an ice cream flavour after him, multiple biographies and books were given the go-ahead and out came Jeremy Lin online video games and iPhone apps. Millions of dollars worth of Lin merchandise has been generated and exchanged in less than a month.Media coverage has been explosive. Lin has appeared on more than 20 consecutive covers of Newsday sports, two consecutive covers of Sports Illustrated, the cover of Time magazine, has been the subject of sports columns around the world for weeks now and even people who barely knew him in college are now the subjects of news stories.The buzz generated from the aftermath of Lin\u2019s emergence is not surprising. Media outlets are businesses that aim to produce the most popular content for their audiences, and there is no doubt that Jeremy Lin is the ultimate story that everyone wants to consume.The problem is it\u2019s come to the point where the attention is less focused on praising Lin\u2019s accomplishments, but rather exploiting the story for every dollar its worth. Media outlets are trying to provide catchy pun headlines and alluring details about Lin\u2019s character to fabricate more buzz and consequently sell their content.So far, some of the consequences include ESPN posting a racist headline referring to Lin\u2019s Asian heritage, established sports columnists criticizing Lin for his very public displays of his Christianity and tabloids gossiping about juicy details regarding his personal life.The coverage has severely watered down the true news value of the Jeremy Lin saga, which was his ability to overcome all the odds through his determination and passion for the game of basketball and establish himself as an important member of the New York Knicks. The transformation of the news coverage to wacky and harmful material has become an unfortunate reality in this day and age, as we saw with Tebow earlier this year. The coverage has fortunately yet to ruin Lin and his heroics, but it\u2019s only a matter of time. ",

    "body": "In an effort to modernize city services, many are moving online, including a new system for booking ice time. \r\rThe city now offers an online system for last-minute bookings where people can see all of the ice times available and book immediately with a credit card. A report on the new system showed 325 online bookings in the first two months leading to $43,000 in revenue for the city. Beacon Hill-Cyrville Coun. Tim Tierney says that he considers that money new revenue. \u201cThis last-minute method wasn\u2019t available before, so that\u2019s 325 pieces of ice we\u2019ve sold that theoretically we wouldn\u2019t have sold last year,\u201d says Tierney.Tierney chairs the information technology subcommittee that developed the system as a part of the first phase of \u201cServiceOttawa,\u201d which provides online access to some city services. Tierney says he hopes to add several more services online, including water bills and pet licensing. While Tierney considers the $43,000 new revenue, Dan Chenier the city\u2019s director of Parks and Recreation, doesn\u2019t jump to the same conclusion. He says that in the past last-minute bookings weren\u2019t labelled separately so it\u2019s impossible to directly compare to past years. \u201cEven when people booked last minute at the arena counter it wasn\u2019t tracked like the online bookings are,\u201d says Chenier.Finding a piece of ice in Ottawa can be difficult, especially during the prime evening hours. Between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., city rinks are normally booked more than 90 per cent of the time. In the limited openings during these hours, the old booking methods didn\u2019t make it easy to snap them up. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the benefits already,\u201d says Tierney. \u201cWhether it\u2019s midday or when teams are eliminated from tournaments, when ice becomes free it\u2019s now being gobbled up.\u201dThe previous booking method required people to fill in a sheet emailed from the city, fax it back specifying time and region, then wait a day or two to hear what is available. \u201cNot only is it resource intensive, let\u2019s face it, after 24-48 hours you\u2019re pretty much fed up with it,\u201d says Tierney. Tierney has first-hand experience booking ice through coaching his son\u2019s hockey team.\u201cIn the past it\u2019s been a nightmare. I would call other coaches to make a game if one had been cancelled,\u201d says Tierney. \u201cYou fill out paperwork, call back when you see what\u2019s available and then decide. But now it\u2019s just one step.\u201dBoth Chenier and Tierney say they expect online bookings to really take off during the next winter season.\u201cThis year was only a soft launch,\u201d says Tierney. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone through a series of advertising at this point or even marketed it to local hockey groups.\u201dBill Graham often plays recreational hockey at the McNabb arena and handles the bookings for his group. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was an online option, but that sounds great and it\u2019s something I\u2019ll definitely look at,\u201d says Graham. He\u2019s been booking the ice-time for his games for 15 years, adding that he hasn\u2019t had too many problems because he books well in advance. \u201cI know it can be slow using \u2018snail mail\u2019 but that\u2019s why I book for the whole year and avoid doing it last minute.\u201dChenier says the system can help make things easier for residents while getting the most use out of the city\u2019s arenas.

Ottawa is on the verge of staking its claim as the hidden gem of the Canadian basketball scene, as the city is in line to land a professional franchise in the National Basketball League (NBL) of Canada.\r\rWith Carleton University and the University of Ottawa at or near the top of the collegiate rankings every year, the nation\u2019s capital has a strong foundation already in place.On the back of that strength, John Kennedy, the commissioner of the NBL of Canada, says he would like to have a franchise in Ottawa within the next two years.\u201cOur hope is to increase the presence of basketball in Ottawa and to provide an opportunity for both players and coaches in Canada,\u201d he says. As yet, an owner and home venue for the team have not been chosen. But Kennedy says there are options out there, including at least one \u201cprospective owner\u201d who has shown interest.Should this plan come to fruition, the city would become the largest market in a league that consists of seven teams. As it stands, the London Lightning hold the title as the strongest franchise, in more ways than one. The Lightning sit atop the league standings with a 27-8 record. They also draw an average of about 3,000 fans per game at the John Labatt Centre.Tickets start at $18 for adults, while seniors and youths receive slight discounts. Those wishing for a closer look at the action can purchase courtside seats that range from $30 to $60. At those prices, local fan Qusai Ali says he would be part of the crowd should a team come to Ottawa.\u201cI love the sport, and $60 isn\u2019t much to watch pro basketball,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially if I can watch an ex-NBA player that I know.\u201dOne cause for concern is the influence that hockey has on the sporting scene in the city, with the Senators and 67\u2019s controlling the market. Fans such as Mike Gibbins are excited about the prospect of a team, but are also concerned that professional basketball \u201cmight not thrive in a hockey-dominant environment.\u201d From football to baseball, the city has seen other professional sports fail before. Yet hockey continues to draw fans in droves.Kennedy says he isn\u2019t worried about the competition for fan support. The commissioner is confident that despite being only eight months old, the league boasts a talent level that will have people reaching into their wallets time and time again.He says it is better than the product offered by the NBA Development League, and equal to that on display in Europe.\u201cThe level of play is a lot better than you think it is,\u201d says Kennedy. \u201cIt is very impressive, so we think we have a good product that people would find entertaining.\u201d The growing popularity of the game in Canada is also hard to ignore. From 1998-2005, there was a 37-per-cent increase in participation for children between the ages of five and 14, according to Statistics Canada. Today, more than 600,000 Canadians hit the courts regularly.One of those players is Kaylum Bobal. A standout performer with the Immaculata Saints senior team, the grade 12 student says a professional club would be a \u201cgreat\u201d addition to the city.\u201cIt would give the people in Ottawa a chance to watch a higher level of basketball that we don\u2019t often see here,\u201d says the 6\u20192\u201d forward. \u201cUniversity basketball is nice, but to watch a professional team would be awesome.\u201dHe adds that the dreams of many young Canadian ballers are often doused before they really have a chance to begin, given the limited avenues a player can turn to.Despite the growth and popularity of the sport, only a handful of Canadians play in the NBA, while few are making a real impact at the highest level of the NCAA game. But with the NBL now in full flight, Bobal says many young players will have a legitimate option to strive for.",

Those visiting the Canadian Museum of Nature can dive into a brand-new exhibit from New Zealand featuring whale tails and tales.\r\rThe exhibit opened March 2 and runs until Sept. 3, giving visitors plenty of time to check out all it has to offer. Its title, \u201cWhales Tohora,\u201d comes from the language of the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. Visitors can look up in awe at the hanging skeleton of a male sperm whale, weighing in at more than 2,000 kilograms and measuring nearly 18 metres. The skeleton comes from New Zealand, where the whale died from a beaching in 2003. The Maori gave the whale to the people of New Zealand, where it was then displayed at the Museum of New Zealand.This skeleton isn\u2019t the first to be shown at the Canadian Museum of Nature. In 2010, the museum finally unveiled the skeleton of a blue whale to showcase on the second floor, a project that was over 30 years in the making. There are only two blue whale skeletons in all of Canada, with the other residing in the Beaty Biodiversity Museum at the University of British Columbia.\u201cWhales Tohora\u201d also features a life-sized model of a blue whale heart, which is nearly as large as a small car, fossils of whale ancestors that are said to have walked on land, recordings of whale voices, and real whale bones, including the spine and ribs of a sperm whale.The exhibit doesn\u2019t focus solely on whales. As its title suggests, \u201cWhales Tohora\u201d also looks at the Maori way of life and how it has long been connected to whales in New Zealand. Different artifacts, images, and videos tell the legends of Maori whale riders as well as give a brief history of New Zealand\u2019s indigenous people.Susan Waugh, senior curator at the Museum of New Zealand, travelled to Ottawa for the opening of the exhibit. While it has also been touring the United States the past few years, she says Canada is the perfect host for an exhibit of this kind.\u201cThere\u2019s so much common history between New Zealand and Canada, like the First Peoples issues or similar economies and interests,\u201d Waugh says. Meg Beckel, president and CEO of the Canadian Museum of Nature, says she also believes this common history and culture gives the exhibit a closer connection to Canada.\u201cBeing able to tell a story of whales through a cultural lens and the lens of the Maori people is so similar to our own cultural stories here in Canada when you think of our own First Peoples and their connection with nature,\u201d Beckel says.Ottawa itself also shares a connection with whales. Stephen Cumbaa, a research scientist at the museum, says whales once swam here when the Champlain Sea covered the Ottawa Valley more than 10,000 years ago.\u201cNot far from here, just up the valley in White Lake, scientists found the remains of a bowhead whale that had been swimming in the sea,\u201d he says. Cumbaa says the museum\u2019s collection holds even more specimens from Ontario, including beluga skeletons.",

Excluding Quebec, there are 15 institutions in Canada that have a baby-friendly designation. \u201cA lot of places in Ontario already have good practices, it\u2019s just a matter of having them recognized,\u201d says Louise Gilbert, a baby-friendly assessor from the Breastfeeding Council of Canada, which oversees the Baby-Friendly Initiative across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s really encouraging to see that two of our community health centres have been taking steps to improve breastfeeding support in the community.\u201dAccording to the World Health Organization, breastfeeding until a baby is six months old improves the health of the child by creating a strong immune system and supplying proper nutrition right from birth. In order to receive a designation\u00a0 as baby-friendly, a centre must not supply free sample baby formulas as a substitute for breastfeeding and must implement a number of steps as outlined by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. These steps include training staff, providing information and support necessary for mothers to make an informed decision and showing them how to breastfeed properly.According to Gilbert, in the case where mothers are unable to produce the amount of milk required for their baby to gain weight, baby formula and other options are discussed to supplement feeding. The CCHC offers prenatal appointments for its clients, and follows them closely with a check-up within 48 hours of discharge from hospital after the baby is born to ensure feeding is going well.

It hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201dOttawa has 246 outdoor skating rinks scattered across the city, with Centretown being home to three of them. All of the rinks are run by volunteers who dedicate dozens of hours per week to maintaining the quality of the ice surfaces \u2013 no easy task, especially this season. \u201cI spend around 30 hours here a week,\u201d says Sean Simpson, the volunteer supervisor of four years at the Jack Purcell skating rink, located by the Jack Purcell Community Centre off Elgin and Frank Streets. \u201cFlooding the ice alone takes about an hour and a half. It\u2019s a lot of work.\u201d The City of Ottawa provides funding to rink supervisors to help with the various costs associated with maintaining the outdoor rinks, including snow removal. While the funding does help, Simpson says it often isn\u2019t enough. \u201cWhen we get a heavy snowfall, I can\u2019t use a shovel or use a snow-blower without damaging the rink,\u201d says Simpson. He often has to rent larger snow removal machines, which means the city funding he receives each year quickly disappears. \u201cAfter two or three heavy snowfalls, the money starts coming out of my own pocket,\u201d says Simpson. Centretown resident and regular skater Adrian Murray believes more funding could help not only improve the maintenance of the ice surfaces, but the overall quality of the outdoor rinks. His favourite rink to frequent is the Plouffe Park rink, located off Preston Street in Little Italy, largely because of the shelter located alongside it. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the ice for a couple hours, it\u2019s nice having a place to warm up in,\u201d says Murray. \u201cWarm shelters at more rinks would be a huge improvement.\u201d Chenier says short of controlling the weather, there isn\u2019t much else the City can do to improve the rinks. But if the winters continue to be mild, he says the City may have to consider building more refrigerated outdoor rinks. There are currently two refrigerated rinks in the city \u2013 the Ben Franklin Park Rink and the recently completed Rink of Dreams.\u00a0 A third rink has already been proposed at Lansdowne Park.But regardless of the weather struggles, Chenier says outdoor rinks remain one of the City\u2019s best winter features. \u201cThe outdoor rinks become a community hubs,\u201d he says. \u201cThey really bring life the parks during the cold winter months.\u201d\u00a0 ",

As the patio stands now, a line of trees cuts that free sidewalk space in half, with only 1.22 metres of clear space on either side.The trees, however, were put in six to seven years after Cotroneo was told by the city that his patio wouldn\u2019t be a problem. According to Cotroneo, the trees were put in the wrong spot.\u201cI went and I got the original drawings from the city,\u201d says Cotroneo. \u201cI looked at the drawings and measured everything out, and the trees that were installed in front of my place were not where they showed on the drawings. In other words, according to my calculations, the trees should have been 17 inches (40 centimetres) closer to the street.\u201d Having the trees 40 centimetres closer to the street, says Cotroneo, would make up most of the 58 centimetre difference in space that the encroachment bylaw mandates.The issue over whether or not Cotroneo\u2019s patio should stay as it has been for over a decade has brought on numerous transportation committee and city council meetings since it was first brought to the attention of Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes, was instrumental in eventually bringing the issue to the transportation committee.The Ottawa public works department and the Ottawa planning and growth management department did not support the motion to grandfather Cotroneo\u2019s patio into the bylaw.Both were worried that if the patio is not scaled back, maintenance equipment such as sidewalk sweepers might not be able to do their job in front of the pub.Cotroneo says he takes care of most of the maintenance in front of his patio and that during the 12 years he\u2019s worked at that location he\u2019s never seen a sidewalk sweeper.Marianne Wilkinson, the chair of the transportation committee, says that over the next patio season the city will be paying close attention to any problems that arise from the decision. As well, the city will address the problem with the trees and will most likely move them 40 centimetres closer to the road. ",

They are also the motto of the global activist initiative, VDay, which was created to stop violence against women and girls.\u201cPeople don't want to talk about sexual assault,\u201d says Jamie Kwong, the funding co-ordinator for the Sexual Assault Support Centre and member of the planning committee. \u201cThis show helps to break the taboos.\u201dThe performance of the Vagina Monologues this year also kicks-off a new year-long campaign just announced by the global VDay organization, called One Billion Rising, for VDay\u2019s 15th anniversary. This event, which will take place all around the world on Feb. 14, 2013, invites women and men to join together in an act of solidarity to support the many women around the world who have experienced gender-based violence. According to Eve Ensler, VDay founder, the goal is to have one billion people \u201cdancing, striking, rising\u201d across borders to show they demand an end to gender-based violence. One billion is based upon a United Nations statistics from its Unite to End Violence Against Women Campaign that says one in three women will be beaten or raped in their lifetime. \u201cOne Billion Rising is about forming a coalition and making people aware of violence against women,\u201d says Kwong.\"It's not only a local issue, it's a global issue; it\u2019s more than just a small group of people.\u201d The local VDay organization is not only about raising awareness of the violence happening both in Ottawa and around the world, but also raising money for local support centres. The Vagina Monologues play, created by Ensler, a Tony award-winning playwright, is performed annually by a cast of volunteers raising money for the Sexual Assault Support Centre of Ottawa and the Minwaashin Lodge Aboriginal Women\u2019s Support Centre.These centres help support women and children who have been victimized or assaulted. Ten per cent of the funds also went to the 2012 VDay spotlight campaign, Women and Girls of Haiti. \u201cIt\u2019s such a positive energy,\u201d says Elizabeth Robson Gordon, one of the Vagina Monologues actors. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that it\u2019s so much bigger than just this, that you\u2019re helping people have a better understanding and compassion for these issues.\u201dRon Couchman, the co-ordinator of I Can MANifest Change organization, says men are also getting more involved with movements to end violence. \"It's about repacking the message in a way related to men and creating a comfortable space to challenge their views,\u201d he says. He addes that events such as the Vagina Monologues help challenge gender stereotypes by making activism enjoyable and humorous for men.\u201cEvents like these allow for men to not always be construed as the perpetrators, and not only to have to deal with the negative aspects, but get involved in a positive way,\u201d says Couchman. One example of this was the men\u2019s bake sale in a room off of the main theatre at the Bronson Centre, for the audience to visit during the intermission.The treats, included a batch of cookies made by Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson to raise money for the Sexual Assault Centre. \"There's so many people working together to stop violence,\" says Stephanie Monette, another one of the actresses in the show. \u201cHopefully, one day, V-Day won't have to happen.\" ",

Steve Gardner of the police\u2019s break and enter unit said there have been a number of robberies in the west, east and south ends of the city in the last month, and the suspects remain at large. Police note that the break-ins start simply. The suspects are let into an apartment building by an unsuspecting resident or when a door is left ajar. Then the culprits use a shaved key known as a \u201cbump key\u201d to pick individual unit locks. Unlike picking the lock and damaging it, a bump key leaves the lock unharmed. Gardner added that picking locks takes more skill. \u201cThe bump key has been around for several years, but this is the first time we\u2019ve seen a considerable number of break and enters in a short period of time using that method,\u201d he said. It\u2019s illegal to possess a bump key because the Criminal Code considers it a burglary tool.In some cases, tenants reported suspicious individuals knocking on their door and providing fake stories when they answered, Gardner said. \u201cPeople in apartment buildings need to be aware of their surroundings. When coming and going from buildings themselves make sure they are not letting people in they don\u2019t know,\u201d said Gardner. \u201cObviously if a stranger comes knocking at your door asking for someone else or with a request that seems out of the ordinary, try to get as much of a description as possible and give us a call.\u201d Gardner said the suspects are stealing things that can be carried away easily like laptops, camera, jewelry and cash.Gardner said they have a few leads, but could not comment further. However, he said the motive seems to be consistent. He added that if people see any suspicious behaviour they should call 613-236-1222, ext. 2636.",

He also said many people think the organization is associated with the police or receives funding from the government, which is not true. Crime Stoppers is completely volunteer-run and relies heavily on public donations and money raised in various fundraisers throughout the year. The Ottawa chapter is not the only one in Canada in danger of going under. \u201cSome chapters are doing well raising funds, and others, like us, are not,\u201d he said.

The Toronto-based catering company sells meals for children in schools and daycares.The kitchen investigated by Ottawa Public Health officials, one of two run by Morris\u2019 franchise, has also been shut down, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re taking the worst-case assumption,\u201d Morris said. \u201cEverything we do is about serving kids nutritious, safe food. This is devastating for us.\u201dOttawa Public Health has found 20 laboratory-confirmed cases of salmonella in the city since March 2, when the outbreak began, said Dr. Rosamund Lewis, Ottawa Public Health\u2019s medical director.Of those cases, 16 involve children between the ages of 15 months and 14 years old who may have eaten meals from the catering franchise, she said.\u201cWe cannot yet be certain that the source we\u2019re looking at is the source,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere are still other possibilities.\u201d\u2028The outbreak has not affected any schools in Centretown, but Ottawa Catholic School Board spokeswoman Mardi deKemp said the board will follow Ottawa Public Health\u2019s direction when informing parents of the outbreak.\u2028Ottawa Public Health representatives have been interviewing the patients\u2019 families and have found that many of the children ate meals from the franchise, she said. The other four patients are adults who may have contracted the illness elsewhere.Morris said the kitchen under investigation has always passed inspections, including one conducted Monday as part of Ottawa Public Health\u2019s investigation.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a very clean record for the five years we\u2019ve been in operation in Ottawa,\u201d Morris said. \u201cEverything\u2019s been good. The kids like the food, our service has been excellent. This is the first time anything has cropped up.\u201dSalmonella is a bacteria found in birds, animals and reptiles, according to Health Canada. Humans can become infected with the bacteria by eating foods that are uncooked or improperly cooked, not washing fruits and vegetables, or not washing their hands after handling raw meat or using the bathroom.Symptoms of the illness, which appear six to 72 hours after infection, include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, fever, chills, abdominal cramps, and sudden headaches. The illness usually passes after four to seven days, but children can sometimes suffer from more serious infections as a result of the illness.Cases have been reported at Turnbull Private School on Fisher Avenue, \u00c9cole Jean-Paul II in Stittsville, and Steve Maclean Public School and Tiny Hopper Day Care in Kanata.Students from both of Ottawa\u2019s English school boards are on their March Break holidays this week, but Ottawa Public Health will be sending information to schools March 15 about the situation, including a reminder about preventing the spread of salmonella through washing hands and toys, Lewis said.Morris said he sent an email Tuesday night to parents who order food for their children through his franchise about the situation.

    "body": "Frances McFadden had little notion as to how many adventures, triumphs, and tragedies she would face upon dropping out of the High School of Commerce and accepting a job with the emerging Canadian Financial Resources Agency \u2013 and neither did I. For a historical fiction based locally, I never expected to get such a thrill following McFadden\u2019s journey in helping to establish the Bank of Canada.\r\rMcFadden was only 17 when she was enlisted in 1934 by her high school principal to help the eccentric Dr. Wilbur Grace establish an archival base for the soon-to-exist Bank of Canada. With the help of Grace and a keen ability to make and maintain as many professional contacts as possible working both with and within the Canadian Government, McFadden continuously finds ways to make herself indispensable to the sort of economic reform the Bank of Canada would eventually bring.Her new-found indispensability allows McFadden to find ways to make working in the dominantly male world of banking not only tolerable, but down-right exciting. McFadden quickly wins over the respect and admiration of her employees, her bosses, and anyone else she comes in contact with using the most effective of Canadian weapons available, politeness.Reading The Underling from the perspective of someone living in Ottawa gives a whole new layer to the story. For me, one of the best aspects to this book was the obviously meticulous research that was put into recreating the city as it stood in the 1930s. From Rochester Street to Elgin Street., from the Chateau Laurier to Holt Renfrew, author Ian McKercher takes his readers back 75 years and keeps them there for 361 pages.\u00a0The UnderlingBy Ian McKercherGeneral Store Publishing House361 pages, $22McKercher is a long-time resident of the Glebe and Old Ottawa South. Having written more than 100 articles for the Glebe Report, The Underling is McKercher\u2019s first attempt at fiction. As a new author, McKercher\u2019s characters are well-developed, the driving force of the story is clear and well-focused, and his writing is detailed to the point of near-authenticity. McKercher tackled the issues of the 1930s with tact and historical accuracy. His portrayal of McFadden\u2019s fight for women\u2019s rights within the Bank of Canada was done in a way which gave such an important issue of the day its due course, but at the same time McKercher did not let the issue take over as the focus of the story. The book, after all, is not just about a woman\u2019s struggle for equality (McFadden is treated better than many of her male colleagues throughout the book), but is instead an underdog story of an unlikely character\u2019s climb to power and influence. McFadden\u2019s youth and gender only add to the unlikeliness of her adventures and her eventual success.The Underling is a first-rate read, although, without giving anything away, I\u2019m not sure I entirely liked the ending. You\u2019ll have to read it for yourself.",

I have Linsanity!\u00a0Not only do I love the underdog-Cinderella story, but his current struggles as an Asian-American basketball player make me to reflect on how far I've come in my own struggles as an Asian-Canadian police officer.\r\rAccording to my mother, I should have been more like my cousin, the computer programmer.\u00a0I should have studied math more, partied less, and fit into\u00a0the stereotypes of\u00a0a \"good\"\u00a0Asian son.\u00a0But I didn't.\u00a0I rebelled, often, failed\u00a0math, often, did what everyone told me not to do and pursued a career in policing.In May 2003, I moved from Ottawa to Hamilton and became the first Vietnamese police officer with the Hamilton Police Service.\u00a0It was a time of mixed emotions and overwhelming pressures. The Hamilton police chief was very excited at\u00a0the opportunity to have his own Asian officer serving the Greater Toronto Area. But the hype of my arrival was quickly replaced with the hard reality of the difficulties some had in accepting what I was, what I am . . . different.All eyes were on me and when I failed at anything, it became\u00a0a big deal.\u00a0You could hear the snickers as I walked down the halls\u00a0at\u00a0the Ontario Police College. \"He\u2019s just window dressing,\" they said. Some officers took it upon themselves\u00a0to never sit with me at lunch. Others went out of their way to disconnect my alarm clock while I was sleeping so that I would show up late to class and be embarrassed. The echoes could be heard from a distance: \"He doesn't belong here.\"Fast forward almost 10 years to 2012.\u00a0The New York Knicks, struggling with a horrible 8-15 record, gave Jeremy Lin a chance to play basketball. Lin had been passed over his entire life by top basketball teams because he didn\u2019t fit the mold. He\u2019s currently the only Asian playing in the predominantly African-American NBA league.From the moment Lin started playing, Knicks' fans no longer felt hopeless, because \"Lin-sanity\" took over and changed the world of basketball as we know it. Jeremy Lin scored more points in his first six games than players like Jordan, Johnson, Iverson, and Lebron James did in their first six games.So, in\u00a0my own twisted rebellious way, I smile at the\u00a0flashes of racism that Jeremy Lin's success has exposed in society. Two ESPN commentators described a New York Knicks\u00a0loss as a \u201cchink\u201d in the\u00a0armor. After\u00a0a spectacular Lin performance, Fox Sports columnist Jason Whitlock tweeted that \u201cSome lucky lady in NYC is going to feel a couple of inches of pain tonight.\u201dWhile playing on his own\u00a0home court, Madison Square Garden, Lin's name is displayed alongside an image of a fortune cookie; as though it would be somehow acceptable for Carmelo Anthony's name to appear next to fried chicken.Racism still exists. It\u2019s a nasty, dirty, and taboo word, racism. It feeds off stereotypes and requires us to stay silent in order to survive.Now, I know what you're thinking, Jeremy Lin plays in the U.S., politically-correct Canadians would never do such a thing. But we do. Our arrogance in believing we're somehow immune to biases and stereotypes is what makes us susceptible to it. However, our ability to discuss difficult issues will determine if we can overcome the challenges we face in an\u00a0ever\u00a0changing world.In the meantime, I'll\u00a0continue planning my trip to New York City to\u00a0bask in Linsanity!",

Nearly 71 per cent of trips made it to all stops on-time during peak morning hours in the last quarter of 2011, compared to 67 per cent of morning rush hour trips in the same quarter of 2010. However, Ottawa\u2019s public transit service saw a decrease in the percentage of afternoon rush hour trips that were running on time compared to anytime in 2010. About 55 per cent of all peak hour afternoon trips made it to every stop on time in the last three months of 2011. This is the poorest afternoon showing for the transit service since mid-2010.The report also provides data on the number of trips that weren\u2019t on time. Trips were more often early than late during the morning rush hour in 2011, but a fifth of the morning trips arrived early during the last three months of the year, putting potential passengers at risk of missing their buses, the report states.More than one quarter of all afternoon trips were more than five minutes late. The report attributes this to \u201cvolatile traffic conditions and other sources of delay in the afternoon, especially downtown.\u201dAfternoon express routes should become more reliable starting in April because of new scheduling practices, the report predicts. OC Transpo released the report in advance of the March 21 city transit committee meeting.

His first suspension will last until April 30. He will have to serve another six-week suspension at a later, as-yet undetermined date.Halpin will have to take three training courses on jurisprudence and ethics, record keeping, and interpersonal skills and workplace relationships. The RCDSO will monitor Halpin for two years after he completes the courses by sending an inspector to Smiles on Sparks to check the dentist\u2019s records and charts. The inspector\u2019s first report will determine the number and frequency of the random checks, said Irwin Fefergrad, the RCDSO\u2019s registrar.\u201cGenerally speaking, the reports would probably be, assuming there are no problems, every three, four months,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are problems, it would be very frequently.\u201d Halpin didn\u2019t appeal the college\u2019s decision, instead releasing a statement to give the context behind the situation.\u2028 \u201cAfter much deliberation about the costs and distraction of pursuing a full-blown and lengthyhearing in these matters, I have chosen to accept the significantly reduced charges brought by the College investigator so that I can move on with my practice and my life,\u201d he said in a written statement released by Smiles on Sparks.In his statement, Halpin said he allowed a dental assistant to place and remove orthodontic wires, elastic and plastic from patients\u2019 teeth, adding that none of his patients complained about these incidents. This led to his charge of delegating tasks to an unqualified person, he said.The findings of providing unnecessary services and charging excessive or unreasonable fees were related to taking panoramic film X-rays of patients\u2019 teeth more frequently than necessary, Halpin said in the statement. The X-rays were taken every three to five years on average, he added.\u201cI made the clinical decision based on what I viewed as in the best interests of my patients.

Currently, Bronson is a four-lane road, but members of Rescue Bronson were hoping to shrink that to three. \u201cIt was a partial victory,\u201d said Robert Dekker, the vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association and a member of Rescue Bronson. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure Bronson was ever meant to be . . . a major conduit that would take people all the way to the airport,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unfortunately that\u2019s what Bronson has become.\u201dBut Kenny said there is too much traffic on the road to make Rescue Bronson\u2019s plan work. \u201cWe certainly looked at that seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hired a separate firm . . .\u00a0 There would be significant delays\u00a0 in the corridor and with significant delays, what happens is you get a lot of cut-through traffic into your side streets. So it was our opinion that it was not a feasible option to bring Bronson down to three lanes.\u201dKenny also said the city would make it easier for drivers to identify pedestrian crossings.There are plans to add more visible crosswalks, decorative lighting and more trees. \u201cIt all maybe doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it starts to provide that pedestrian-friendly corridor along the side of Bronson and starts to give motorists the image of Bronson (as) something other than a highway.\u201dIn the meantime, Holmes, other members of Rescue Bronson, and Centretown residents are still campaigning to reduce fast-moving traffic.The current speed limit of the road is 50 km/h. One suggestion coming from Holmes\u2019s office is to put a traffic light at the intersection of Bronson and Arlington.City staff has agreed to accept the proposal. While Dekker said he\u2019s hopeful that he can keep lobbying city planners to do more, Holmes said she\u2019s less optimistic. \u201cI don\u2019t expect the speeding to stop because the engineers are not interested,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t consider that part of their job.\u201d ",

But this month, organizers announced that future programming would not take place on NCC parkland \u2013 where one million tulips are still set to bloom this spring \u2013 but at various business areas across the city. The unexpectedly high cost of hosting events on the parkland is why the festival ended their 59-year relationship with the NCC, says David Luxton, volunteer chair and financial patron of the Canadian Tulip Festival.\u201cIt\u2019s just too expensive to operate there. The costs keep going up.\u201dLuxton says the festival\u2019s budget is about $2 million, receiving grants from the City of Ottawa, Heritage Canada and the Ontario government.The government of Ontario announced that they would hand the festival a $350,000 grant March 21, meaning that the Tulip Festival's funding requirements have been largely satisfied. Prior to any festival on NCC property, organizers need to hand over a \u201cperformance bond\u201d \u2013 an estimated fee for restoring the land back to its original condition once the events are complete. The amount varies and depends on such things as the weather, the size of the festival, its length, and the overall damages it creates.Jean Wolff, a spokesperson for the NCC, said the festival\u2019s restoration fees ended up being $9,000 more than the projected performance bond last year. This may have frustrated the festival officials, but the NCC is always helpful and lenient with these costs, he says.\u201cNCC staff has made numerous recommendations about ways to mitigate \u2026 the cost of the work that would need to be done after the festival,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Canadian Tulip Festival has also enjoyed an exemption from the basic permit fees of using NCC parks.\u201d But Luxton says the NCC doesn\u2019t always cooperate. At a financial negotiation for this year\u2019s 60th-anniversary festival, the NCC added \u201ctens of thousands of dollars at the last minute,\u201d refusing to issue the necessary permit unless the festival agreed to the new terms, he says.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know why the NCC would be making a statement that it\u2019s only $9,000 more, that is just silly,\u201d Luxton says. \u201cThey know perfectly well that that\u2019s not the case.\u201dBoth Luxton and Wolff say the issue of high fees could not be resolved, even after months of discussion.Luxton, who started considering a \u201ccommunity-based festival\u201d last fall, says the new collaborative approach will not only benefit the local economy but also save money and resources for the festival, allowing organizers to provide funding and organizational assistance to community areas.\u201cThere will be a lot more pageantry, a lot more going on in many more locations, and a lot more community talent will be showcased,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is truly going to make it more of a community festival that is a lot more visible to visitors.\u201dLuxton says he has received positive feedback from business improvement areas.Shirley Fang, executive assistant of the Somerset Street Chinatown Business Improvement Area, says her board started brainstorming ways to attract crowds to her area as soon as organizers contacted her in December.Solar lanterns will decorate Somerset Street, artists will perform and display their crafts, and Chinatown businesses will bloom tulips and host special events, she says.\u201cWe are very happy to partner with the Tulip Festival to celebrate its 60th anniversary,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for businesses as it not only attracts the local clients but the tourism market as well.\u201dOther downtown business groups, such as Preston Street, Sparks Street, Westboro Village and the Byward Market, have also expressed an interest in participating in the festival\u2019s new direction.Luxton says the festival\u2019s preliminary plan includes growing more tulips throughout participating business areas, transferring visitors to events by shuttle bus, and coordinating the international pavilion \u2013 a festival mainstay that features ethnic performers and cuisine at Major\u2019s Hill Park \u2013 into one business area.The pavilion may be located somewhere in Little Italy, as local businesses have indicated to the festival that they want the added business the festival could generate.\u00a0 Similar to Winterlude, most programming will be free to the public, he says.\u201cSome specifics of the 2012 festival remain a work in progress at this date, with more still to be done with BIAs and other community partners,\u201d Luxton says.He adds that the final lineup and details for this year\u2019s festival will be released in late March or early April. \u201cBut the enthusiasm and ideas I\u2019ve heard from many of the BIAs and other partners encourage me to believe that there will be interesting added attractions animating the National Capital Region at tulip time.\u201dAttracting about 500,000 tourists to the city each year, the festival will run from May 4 to 12, 2012.

    "body": "Laurier Avenue West\u00a0 residents have launched a petition calling for the immediate removal of the street's segregated bike lanes amid safety concerns and the lack of on-street parking for visitors. \r\rThe petition comes after Orl\u00e9ans Coun. Bob Monette asked city staff during a recent transportation committee meeting to consider making major changes to the bike lanes. Possible changes include moving one direction of travel to an adjacent parallel street and closing the eastbound lane next winter to minimize the impact on residents and businesses. Organized by the Bay/Bronson Resident\u2019s Action Group for Fair Access to the Road, the petition has been circulated among businesses along Laurier. Many businesses have placed it on their front counters for customers to sign. \u201cWe do not want to cancel the bike lane system, but we want the city to use common sense to decide how this can be done with the least disruption to both residents and businesses,\u201d says petition organizer, Janine Hutt. She says the cement curbs separating the bike lanes from the road pose serious safety concerns during the winter months because of snow and ice and are a headache for people with mobility issues. \u00a0Richard Asselin, a local resident and petition organizer, says the lack of parking is \u201ckilling life on Laurier.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThink of your own home. Generally you have parking on your own street.\u00a0 Now imagine if you had to tell your guests to go park on another street,\u201d he says, referencing numerous instances where guests have had to park blocks away from his apartment. \u00a0The lanes, which run on each side of Laurier from Bronson Avenue to Elgin Street, are part of a two-year, $1.3 million pilot project that began last July. Prior to the launch of the pilot project, the group asked city council to consider a variety of options, including a two-way lane on one side of Laurier, using painted lanes without cement barriers, or only allowing segregated bike lanes from Elgin Street to Lyon Street. All of these suggestions were ignored, says Asselin. Business owners have joined the petition in protest of the bike lanes because the lack of parking is hurting their bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting everyone\u2019s business. If you have a delivery or if someone wants to quickly buy something they can\u2019t because there is no parking,\u201d says Jean Elkhoury, owner of Presse Caf\u00e9. \u00a0Hussein Yehia, owner of Calvina Gourmet International, agreed and says he now has to open his caf\u00e9 at 5:30 a.m., an hour and a half earlier than he used to, in order to receive shipments. \u00a0\u201cI am losing 15 to 20 per cent in revenue from customers because nobody can park here. If I lose customers, how can I pay rent?\u201d However, many bike enthusiasts argue it is too early to evaluate the pilot project, saying the city has already made various changes to the bike lanes to accommodate business concerns.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think it is a bit premature to make changes if it hasn\u2019t even survived the first year yet. We should wait until we have more data,\u201d says Hans Moor, president of Citizens for Safe Cycling. He says there are various other reasons businesses could be losing money, including a poor economy or increased competition and they should not blame their woes entirely on the bike lanes. Since July, the Laurier bike lane has recorded more than 200,000 trips and is one of the busiest bike lanes in Canada, Moor says. The petition is expected to be presented to the city by the end of this month.",

On Monday mornings, a small group files into a room in the Centretown Community Health Centre. At 10:30, the lights are dimmed and the room goes quiet.\r\rThe men and women aren\u2019t there for yoga class. They\u2019re there for addiction treatment.But, there are no methadone injections or nicotine patches passed around. The treatment offered in this room is acupuncture.Acupuncture is a technique from ancient Chinese medicine involving the placement of superfine needles in certain points on the body. Two thousand years ago, it was used to try to re-balance the body\u2019s energy.Today, it\u2019s still used to treat a wide range of ailments from shingles to withdrawal symptoms. A specific method called Acu-Detox, that mandates five needles inserted into the cartilage of each ear, is the standard for addiction treatment. For 45 minutes, each person will sit silently in the dim light, with ten needles standing like porcupine spikes from the sides of their heads.And it helps, says their acupuncturist, Emi, who for professional safety reasons didn\u2019t want her last name used.\u201cThey may say they\u2019ve noticed they get better sleep; some say \u2018It\u2019s helped me have less, or not so intense cravings or urges.'\u201dEmi is an addictions counsellor at the Centretown CHC and the founder of the program. April marks its one-year anniversary.She was a regular acupuncture client for years before she became\u00a0 certified to lead addiction-specific acupuncture treatment. The sessions are nonverbal, meaning that unlike much of the therapy Emi leads, those in the circle aren\u2019t expected to share their feelings about their addictions.\u201cIt allows people to participate in a group event when they\u2019re not comfortable sharing with other people,\u201d she says. Emi says she\u00a0 doesn\u2019t know what brings some of the attendees to the health centre.The use of acupuncture to treat withdrawal symptoms dates back to Hong Kong in the 1970s, and has continued to inspire medical research since then. Studies on acupuncture\u2019s effect on hypertension and pain management have concluded it can create positive results but acupuncture as addiction treatment is still controversial. Proponents say lab tests show addicts suffer weaker cravings after acupuncture treatment, while cynics point to trials showing negligible improvements. Science has yet to come up with an explanation for how these needles affect the body\u2019s chemistry.Greg Ward, an Ottawan who has been fighting his drug addictions for over 30 years, is a convert. He\u2019s a regular at an acupuncture program at the Sandy Hill Community Health Centre, as well as at a more modern-era group therapy program.\u201cI think it\u2019s the combination of the old and the new that really works for me,\u201d he said.\u201cTalking is important but the acupuncture is real, it\u2019s physical, it\u2019s tangible, you know? Sometimes it\u2019s nice to actually do something physical.\u201dWard has been clean for several months. He says he still thinks about using, but not with the same intense craving. After each acupuncture session, he feels \u201ccalm, relaxed, focused.\u201dTranquillity is often needed by those with addictions, says Cat Biljan, head of the Ottawa Mission's acupuncture program. \u201cWe take a good night of sleep for granted, but for someone with an addiction, getting that and getting a sense of calm can absolutely leave you in a better place to deal with cravings,\u201d she says. Jici Xu, owner of Xu Acupuncture on O\u2019Connor Street, says addiction treatment is only a small part of his business, but interest is steady. He charges $50 a half hour and recommends two or three treatments a week.In contrast, the program at the health centre is free.",

The centre opened between May and September each year to support youth in their job search.\u201cIt\u2019s a very disappointing decision,\u201d says Chantle Beeso, vice president of student issues for the Carleton University Students\u2019 Association. \u201cIt could be detrimental to students looking for jobs because they can no longer get the one-on-one time the centres provided to help them apply.\u201dOver 300 youth employment centres across the country are closing down at a time when the youth unemployment rate hovers at just over 14 per cent, according to Statistics Canada. The figure does not include thousands of youth who are underemployed and often working part-time jobs at wages too low to cover the basic costs of living.The centres themselves were a source of jobs, as each employed a couple staff members. The youth unemployment rate is double that of the rest of Canadians.\u201cPeople graduating have a tough time finding jobs, and these centres provided access to jobs students may not have seen before,\u201d says Beeso. \u201cThey gave great services and attention, (the employees) were mentors who gave good advice\u2026 it was a win-win situation for businesses looking to hire and students looking to work.\u201dThe office of Diane Finley, minister of human resources and skills development, contends that the number of students visiting the centres has decreased significantly over the last few years, making them less effective and relevant.\u201cYouth across the country have told us they want to access more government services online, including help with job searches and resum\u00e9 writing,\u201d says Finley\u2019s spokeswoman, Alyson Queen. \u201cIn response we are expanding the website (www.youth.gc.ca) with new resources to help youth find employment.\u201dThe Canadian Federation of Students is lobbying Finley to continue operating the seasonal youth employment centres. The federation\u2019s chair Roxanne Dubois says online services will not be enough to help students find jobs.\u201cA website cannot replace a real person that provides advice on how to write a resum\u00e9 and perform well in an interview,\u201d she says.

The homes act as an incubator for pregnant foreigners who travel to Canada for the purpose of giving birth within our borders. \r\rRoom and board are offered for under $100 a day and, in return, the mother-to-be can wait to deliver a child, who will automatically receive Canadian citizenship and a passport. These foreign mothers, and the entrepreneurs that support them, are among the growing number of people taking advantage of an out-of-date loophole in Canadian citizenship policy. Canada and the U.S. are the only developed countries that grant citizenship to any child born within their borders, regardless of the citizenship of the parents, or how long they have been in the country. Luckily, the myriad of negative consequences that come with this outdated policy have not eluded Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenny who wants to scrap the policy by the end of this year. Critics say that eliminating the loophole would be complicated and expensive. Some immigration lawyers claim that it would be impossible to revoke citizenship status given to babies born through birth tourism. \u00a0Critics argue that unless the government gathers family trees from all citizens,and then conducts immigration investigations to revoke status given to foreign nationals, there would be both \u201clegitimate\u201d and \u201cillegitimate\u201d Canadian passports and birth certificates floating around. That\u2019s like saying there\u2019s no point in shutting the gate when the horses are already out. But can\u2019t we add a latch for the future? We can, and should, make the change and start applying it now. Yes, it may be a hassle to ask for proof of citizenship from parents at the time of birth. But, imagine the cost to the health-care system as a result of our hospitals covering the delivery fees for people who might hop on a plane the very next day. Destination: home, with a brand new Canadian baby and no hospital bills. This Canadian citizen can return to Canada at any time when he or she is in need of free education or health-care benefits. To give these privileges to people who have not lived in, or contributed to, our society sends the message that we do not place a high value on our citizenship.Passport babies can also use their citizenship to sponsor family members to immigrate to Canada, which cuts corners on our established immigration process. Canadian citizens enjoy many freedoms and advantages and in 2010 we opened our doors and shared these privileges with 280,636 people who were willing to go through the necessary immigration steps. The application process is there for a reason \u2013 to ensure commitment to Canadian values and contribution to our society. In order to receive citizenship, immigrants should have something to offer in return, or have a legitimate cause for refugee status. Canadians need to start asking how much value we place on our nationhood, because, right now, we\u2019re handing out citizenship for the cost of a plane ticket and a cheap hotel room.",

    "body": "Talbert Johnson  Sitting in a small, quiet caf\u00e9 sipping a latte on a weekend morning is one of life's small pleasures. Sprawling out the newspaper on a table to read cover-to-cover. Catching up with a friend without the hectic schedule of the workweek. These are the moments worth relishing. That is, until a gaggle of parents and tots come parading in, SUV strollers and all.\r\rAccording to the City of Ottawa\u2019s 2003 demographic report, 20-somethings represent 28 percent of the downtown population, the highest concentration of this age group in Ottawa. Centretown was once the bastion of students, artists and ultra-hip professionals. It is now teeming with a new brand of hipster parents who let their little ones run their lives, inflicting their unruly offspring on the latte-sipping masses.The idea that children belong everywhere is absurd. There seems to be very little understanding of the concept of \u201cadult time\u201d or \u201cadult space\u201d anymore. Parents bring their kids everywhere and expect to have people and establishments accommodate their every need. Clashes between parents and non-parents are the result of an upward trend of the birth rate in Canada. According to a 2009 report from Statistics Canada, the number of births by women between the ages of 30 and 34 were the highest among all age groups for the fifth consecutive year. \u202fResearchers also found the largest decrease in births between 2008 and 2009 in women aged 20 to 29. Parents are using most of their 20s to concentrate on their career and social life, putting off child-rearing into their thirties.Where the idea of parenting was once a top-down, authoritative practice in most hwouseholds, indulgent parents now seem to make up the majority. Paul Martin is a former Cambridge University behavioural scientist. In his book, Making Happy People. Martin defines indulgent parents as responsive but undemanding and permissive, setting few clear boundaries for their children.\u201cThey often respond to their children\u2019s wishes, even when these are unreasonable or inappropriate,\u201d he says in the book. \u201cPunishments are seldom threatened, let alone carried through, and the children often appear to have the upper hand in the relationship. Indulgent parents try to be kind, but shy away from conflict or difficulty.\u201dThe idea of extended adolescence is at work here. Traditionally, sociologists define the transition to adulthood with five milestones: completing school, leaving home, becoming financially independent, marrying and having a child. In 2001, a Canadian study reported that the typical 30-year-old had completed the same number of milestones as a 25-year-old in the early \u201970s. As a result of the change in the average age of parents, the idea of what it means to be a parent and methods of doing so have also changed.The decision to have children is just that: a decision. And while babies don\u2019t come with an instruction manual, society expects them to have read it. Part of that means parents suppressing their impulses to do, go and see everything they want to, and bring the kids along with them.\u00a0While public spaces are open to each and every one of us, there needs to be a certain level of decorum so all people can collectively enjoy themselves. That means parents should be making a reasonable effort to make sure their kids aren't bothering other people. If the child won't behave or sit still on their own, it's up to the parent to take responsibility for this. One of your responsibilities is to know your child and what they are capable of doing. \u202fFor those of us tired of free-range parents letting their little ones roam free, there may hope for a quieter ambiance around town. In her new book Bringing up B\u00e9b\u00e9, author Pamela Druckerman explores the art of French parenting. While living as an American expatriate in Paris, Druckerman was struck by the comparatively placid, well-rounded demeanor of French children, she endeavors to learn the secrets of French parenting.Rebecca Dana, senior correspondent for The Daily Beast \u202fsums up the French way of raising well-behaved youngsters in her review of Druckerman's book.\u201cUnlike their American counterparts, French women are not obsessed with their kids,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t lose themselves in parenting. They do not negotiate, tolerate tantrums, provide excessive snacks, or waste weekends shepherding little ones from soccer practice to birthday parties to kiddie discos.\u201dThere\u2019s a time and place for letting your kids run free, at the park or playground for instance. But where there are other people in a relatively close environment, letting your child run loose, throw a tantrum and generally be a nuisance is neither the time nor the place. It\u2019s a matter of respect for those around you. Even though you might think throwing food or running up and down restaurant aisles is cute, it is most likely that other patrons and staff do not.So hire a babysitter and take some adult time. After all, it\u2019s tough to be a parent, and everyone deserves a break sometimes. And everyone around you will appreciate the child-free peace and quiet just as much as you do.\u00a0",

A recent open letter sent to the government says the Canadian government is muzzling its scientists, especially on issues involving the environment.Similarly, a report released at the end of February says a Carleton University professor mislead his students about climate change science.Canadians are getting a muddled message about how our environment is changing.The majority of the scientific body of evidence in this area shows the planet\u2019s climate is warming because of human damage to the environment. Why, then, are Canadians still receiving politically spun information \u2013 or none at all \u2013 about global warming?The open letter by the Canadian Science Writers\u2019 Association asks Prime Minister Stephen Harper to unmuzzle government scientists and let them speak to the media about their research. The letter cites the recent examples of two federal scientists barred from speaking to the media about ozone layer research and a study on salmon decline in British Columbia, respectively.Researchers and commentators discussing this case suggested that controlling the spread of the data in these studies was an effort by the government to supress evidence that shows how serious climate change really is.This type of message control by our policy makers, driven by political motivations, has terrifying implications about decision-making in this country.The other case that hit the newspapers this month concerns a professor at Carleton University who taught students climate change science that fundamentally ignored the majority of the evidence.An elective course taught by Prof. Tom Harris entitled Climate Change: An Earth Sciences Perspective, taught that climate change presents no threat to humans or the Earth, according to a study of the material conducted by four Carleton University professors.Harris dismissed the report as unfair, saying the reviewers were unqualified to critique his course because they are biologists. He also said he didn\u2019t deny any claims about climate change, he simply presented alternative views about the phenomenon\u2019s origins.Nonetheless, this course clearly supported a view that represents a tiny proportion of the evidence. Failing to place the course\u2019s alternative perspective within context of the larger body of scientific research is plain and simply misinforming students. There is a place for alternative perspectives in universities, where academic freedom is key. But in science, evidence trumps argument every time. Say it as many times as you like, the earth was never at the centre of the universe.Harris needs to step away from his political leanings and consider the impact of his discourse on the students whose views he\u2019s shaping.Canadians need to start receiving clear messages about the scientific evidence supporting climate change that moves beyond the \u201cis it real or not\u201d debate.Twisting the facts on climate change breeds public misunderstanding. It\u2019s a subversion of democracy and could prove disastrous for the planet.",

Making the Canadian Improv Games is no easy task, but it\u2019s something Lisgar Collegiate Institute has become quite good at.\r\rOn April 5, the Centretown-based high school will be performing at the National Arts Centre in front of nearly a thousand people in the preliminary rounds of the annual high school competition. Only 20 of about 3,000 schools qualify, but Lisgar has qualified almost every year since 2004, won a national title in 1999 and 2000 and was even featured in a documentary about the improv art form.The tournament\u2019s director, AL Connors, says a team can\u2019t have that kind of success without a great coach. \u201cIt\u2019s all about creating positivity for the kids. If a coach has a positive energy, it usually translates into a team that\u2019s good no matter who is on it,\u201d he says.Lisgar\u2019s coach, Kathleen Klassen, started a team at Lisgar in 1996. It only took her three years to build a national champion. She wasn\u2019t a full-time coach last year and her school failed to qualify for the improv games.Klassen says she uses drama to emphasize communication, confidence and emotional support instead of just teaching the building blocks of improv.\u201cFor me, a team has to understand the notion of working together, developing synergy and working towards a goal as a unit,\u201d she says. \u201cIncreasing self-esteem in students is what I consider the most important element of drama.\u201d Lisgar will need to use that confidence if they wish to advance through the preliminary round and on to the final on April 7. Only the top five schools advance.Sandra Chwialkowska was a member of Lisgar\u2019s 1999 national championship team. She also filmed a documentary chronicling the school\u2019s journey to the games in 2007. \u00a0She says Klassen\u2019s teaching techniques can help students get ready for the national spotlight. \u00a0\u201cPerforming on that stage is so daunting, especially for a young high school student,\u201d says Chwialkowska. \u201cBut Klassen makes your team your second family \u2013 she creates a positive environment where you won\u2019t fail because everybody supports each other.\u201dKlassen says the students are dedicating significant time to prepare for the Improv Games, including four practices a week. She says practice is necessary to build their confidence by getting them to commit to characters and different scene narratives.\u201cI use lots of breathing techniques to help calm them. I use the concepts of team - that they have others to rely on and to support them to sustain them through their events,\u201d she says.Chwialkowska says Klassen-run practices are long and rigorous. \u201cThey\u2019re tough, but we all wanted to be there because Kathleen makes it fun. She makes you want to be there because she is enjoying it herself as well,\u201d she says.Chwialkowska says you can learn valuable life lessons with improv. She says it helps you think on your toes, listen to others, perform on stage and build a sense of community.Klassen agrees. She says she teaches improv because she believes students can learn from the dramatic arts. \u201cLearning to adjust to the new is one of the most important skills we can learn in life,\u201d says Klassen. \u201cWe never know what new information we will get in life. Improv is about taking new information to alter the course of a scene.\u201dThe national competition is open to the public for $18 a night.",

    "body": "When a musician stands onstage at a concert and declares that he hopes his music challenges the structure of the building, there is a problem with the venue.\r\rThis happened at the Mother Mother concert in November at the Bronson Centre. The concert hall is the old theatre of Centretown\u2019s Immaculata High School. It is filled with rows of theatre-style seats and a stage. There is also a balcony filled with seats overlooking the stage.There is very little room to dance, there is no coat check, and there is no bar. If you do want a beverage, you need to leave the theatre and sometimes there is a table set up with drinks on sale. It is very hard to socialize in the concert hall because with the seats side by side, people are forced to direct their attention at the stage and cannot comfortably make conversation with others around them. This may be good for an acoustic gig, but is not ideal for any upbeat show. Concerts are about the music, but the atmosphere also contributes to the experience. Audience members have said that waiting for a show at the Bronson Centre feels much like waiting for an amateur community play to begin. As one tweeter, @robrames, put it, \u201cI\u2019m in a high school auditorium (@The Bronson Centre\u2026).\u201dAnother person who reviewed the Bronson Centre on the Internet, known only as Haley R., said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t have the energy or the space for a good rock concert.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather not be so displaced from the action by 30 rows of filled seats or up on the balcony,\u201d she explained. \u00a0Although the design of the Bronson Centre theatre is less than ideal for many concerts, the venue has been attracting lots of big names. Lady Gaga, Hey Rosetta!, Theory of a Deadman, Down With Webster, Broken Social Scene, Tegan and Sara, Against Me! and many more high-profile artists have performed there.There must be something the Bronson Centre is doing right if it is attracting these musicians.A\u00a0 reason may be that it is one of Ottawa\u2019s only concert halls with such large capacity. The Bronson Centre, which can hold 900, is a good option for artists who want a large space, but do not want to go to an upscale venue like the National Arts Centre or the Scotiabank Place out in suburban Ottawa. As well, the NAC and Scotiabank Place can hold significantly more than 900 people and may be too big for some shows. But just because the Bronson Centre is a good alternative does not mean it is utilizing its full potential. The centre can still improve the experience of concertgoers and make it more appealing to bands and music lovers. With simple renovations, the atmosphere could be transformed. The Bronson Centre should remove some of the chairs from the main level of the theatre, opening up the space for a dance floor. This would still leave some seating on the first floor and a whole balcony of seats for those who prefer to sit down. The Bronson Centre should also allocate space to be used as a bar and create a coat check. This would make the experience of guests more positive and generate revenue in the long run. People wouldn\u2019t have to lug around their winter jackets all night or leave the show to get a drink. These changes may seem simple, but would do a lot to enhance the experience of attending a concert at the Bronson Centre. Although the venue is already doing well, it could become the best large location for concerts in the city.",

There\u2019s a new shop in Centretown for local artists to show their work, but the art they practice is far from traditional.\r\rThe art, performed in the streets, merges sport and creative expression through skateboarding.The store, Antique, combines local graphic designers and athletes to foster a sense of community with skateboarding enthusiasts, while showcasing local talent. \u201cSkateboarding is a very creative activity because there are no rules,\u201d says owner Aaron Cayer. \u201cIt\u2019s very subjective, you can never attribute points, like something like the Olympics.\u201dAs an individual activity, Cayer says it is easy to express oneself through the sport.One of the biggest barriers to skateboarding is finding people to do it with, he says, which is why the store will be a meeting place. Indeed, it is filled with young skateboarders who practice outside the store on Florence Street.The front of the store houses a \u201cCommunity Board\u201d where there are interviews with local skateboarders printed out on large placards, a map of the best places to skate in the city, and other resources to help make connections with other Ottawa skateboarders.\u201cA skate company should give back to the community that supports it,\u201d says Cayer, adding the store will also serve as a venue for local artists and bands. The opening showcased paintings by tattoo artists Julian Garner, and Joel Conroy.\u201cWe wanted an open concept in a store to be able to host parties, shows, art shows,\u201d says Cayer. \u201cI only know that it has to match the hard work and passion that we put into the shop.\u201dCayer says skateboarding is an activity that bridges the gap between people who may not be able to afford to play team sports. Tom Pajdlhauser, the store\u2019s creative director, says team sports aren\u2019t accessible due to the high cost of equipment.\u201cSkateboarding takes less equipment and promotes creativity and individuality,\u201d says Pajdlhauser, who also works as a graphic artist and co-designed the interior of store with Garner. The inside of the store is made entirely of materials that one would use to construct a skate park. Antique is currently working with the city and the Ottawa Skateboard Community Association, developed by Cayer, to build more skate parks, including the city\u2019s first indoor park. Kyle Robertson, the store\u2019s manager, says without this kind of venue, skateboarders have to travel to Montreal when they can\u2019t ride in the city. Antique will also act as a reference for people looking to build their own skate parks, and will put skateboarders in touch with those who can help construct it. Cayer says the store will provide other products such as cement to build the parks, free of charge.These tools are bought with the profit made from the store, which sells clothing designed by local graphic artists as well as other goods like skateboarding shoes.

The April 28 event promises to bring the community together for a day filled with bluegrass roots music, dance, theatre and storytelling. \r\rBob Nesbitt, founder of the event, says a number of factors led him to create the local festival. His love of folk music and involvement in the Ottawa Folk Festival as site manager for several years were factors, but ultimately he says it was his friends who persuaded him to put the project together. \u201cThere were a lot of friends who wanted to have a small, family oriented, simple festival,\u201d says Nesbitt.Nesbitt and other organizers, rallied a variety of musicians, actors, storytellers and other local talents to participate. The event will include an afternoon of free\u00a0 activities and an evening show costing $25 in advance or $30 at the door. \u00a0The festival was made possible by local sponsors including The Ottawa Folklore Centre, Constant Sound Studio, CKCU FM 93.1, Spirit of Rasputin\u2019s Arts Society and more. Ticket sales from the evening performance will go towards funding the event. \u00a0During the day, attendees can expect ukulele sing-alongs with the Bytown Ukulele Group, contra dancing, yoga and storytelling with poet Albert Dumont. Maple Hill, an award-winning bluegrass band, will also offer a workshop teaching aspiring musicians how to build a band. Finally, kids and adults can perform on an open stage and showcase their talents.The Ottawa Phoenix Playback Theatre is another planned feature of the festival. \u201cIt\u2019s an interactive form of story-telling where you get the stories of your community. \u201cIt\u2019s community building,\u201d explains Jane Keeler, conductor and MC of the theatre troupe. Playback invites people from the audience to talk about moments and events in their life. After a quick interview, the actors create a dramatized improv skit of the story using music, movement and dialogue. \u201cIt reflects the feelings and experience and sometimes shows you something you didn\u2019t even realize,\u201d says Keeler. Folk singer-songwriter Ana Miura will also participate in the festival and believes the local community is one to be valued. \u201cI\u2019ve built a lot of friendships and relationships within music and I love the Ottawa music community because it\u2019s artistically inspiring,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be a part of it (the festival) because I love events that show a lot of community and that bring together great people.\u201d The evening includes a speech from Dumont, followed by folk music performances from Ottawa\u2019s Missy Burgess and award-winning artists Rick Fines and Katherine Wheatley. With the Ottawa Grassroots Festival all set to go for next month, Nesbitt recently held a launch party for the event on March 7. \u201cThe purpose of the launch was twofold, first to draw the festival to the attention of the press, and second, to create some buzz in the folk community,\u201d says Nesbitt. \u00a0Held at Pressed, a new coffee and sandwich bar, on Gladstone Street, the launch included meet and greets with organizers, performers and volunteers.

Now, a gallery held in conjunction with the Juno Awards aims to expose the works of Canadian artists on a national stage.\u00a0 \r\rThe gallery opened on March 16 at the Museum of Civilization. It features the album art from the \u201cRecording Package of the Year\u201d Juno Awards category from 1975 to the present. Among the album covers are Moving Pictures by Rush, and exit by k-os. In addition, the display will include photographs from the past 40 years of the Juno Awards. \u201cIts a chance to showcase wonderful works of art from people that aren\u2019t necessarily associated with the music scene\u201d said Jill Primeau, a representative from the Juno Awards. The concept for the album art gallery came about in 2011, which was the 40th anniversary of the Junos. \u201cWe came up with the idea while working with the Art Gallery of Ontario,\u201d Primeau said. \u201cOften times, these artists don\u2019t get the spotlight like others\u2026so we\u2019re grateful that the Canadian Museum of Civilization jumped on board with this project.\u201dKim Ridgewell is a British Columbia-based artist who is one of the nominees for this year\u2019s Recording Package of the Year. She shares the nomination for her work on the packaging for the album \u201cRest of the Story\u201d by jazz musician Chris Tarry with designer Jeff Harrison.By combining elements of Tarry\u2019s work as an author with his music, Ridgewell and Harrison crafted a book that contains illustrations that lead into the album. Turning the pages of the book reveals a cut out segment where the CD is located. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlbum artwork is one of the first [things] I remember associating with art when I was young,\u201d Ridgewell said. \u201cPulling them off shelves and examining them, there was just such a wide range of work.\u201d When asked about her nomination, she said that it was \u201cvery exciting\u201d as it was \u201cout of the traditional award camp for us...being nominated with a bunch of musical artists.\u201dWith digital sales dominating music revenue, the creation of unique album artwork can be hard, according to Ridgewell. \u201cSo much of the work that we do now\u2026is downloaded or accessed through iTunes, so although you see that album cover, it doesn\u2019t have that interactivity,\u201d she said.The ability to interact with an art form traditionally consigned to dingy record store bins is a sound idea, according to one music fan.\u201cAn exhibit showcasing the past Juno award winners is an excellent idea for a companion to the ceremony,\u201d said Robert Nelson. A lover of Canadian music, he's excited to visit the display.Nelson has spent a number of years working in the Canadian folk music scene. As a result, he\u2019s had plenty of exposure to artists who are flying under the radar. \u201cMusic is, like all art forms, based upon the work that has come before it. By featuring the past winners of the Junos, it is unique way of celebrating the work that has come before, and served as inspiration for this year\u2019s nominees,\u201d Nelson said. \u00a0The exhibit will run until April 9.

The charity was formed by the friends and family of Daron Richardson, daughter of former Ottawa Senators assistant coach, Luke Richardson. The 14-year-old took her life in 2010. The Brain and Mental Health Art Show, at Grounded Kitchen & Coffeehouse on Gloucester, was the culmination of this year\u2019s Brain Awareness Week, an annual national event organized by the Society for Neuroscience.\u201cIf someone with mental health issues is here tonight, and everybody is here with a positive attitude, everybody\u2019s talking about it, then they\u2019re going to feel more comfortable talking about their own experiences with mental health,\u201dsaid SfN Ottawa president Mark Patterson. The SfN asked the public to send in a piece of art that represented what the brain and mental health meant to them, says Patterson. In response, he says, they received art from \u201ceverywhere under the sun.\u201dThe art itself ranged from a knitted brain to a black and white photograph of a person - nothing but the hint of a silhouette - pressing against a gauzy curtain. The diversity was great, says Morgan Ip. He came to the show after a friend piqued his interest, and knows how it feels to be both affected by mental illness and in the dark about it. He\u2019s been educating himself, but still has trouble talking about it.\u201cThere was a close family friend of mine who had a mental health issue,\u201d he said, \u201cand a friend that I had recently took his life.\u201d Mental health issues affect everyone, he says, and knowing more people are talking about it instead of hiding it definitely helps understand what issues are out there.

When school kicks off next September, students at Lisgar Collegiate Institute will be able to use laptops and iPads at their desks to wirelessly connect to the Internet, despite being taught in a 140-year-old building.\r\rThe technological update is part of an effort by the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board to install Wi-Fi in all 147 of its public schools by the end of August, says Dave Miller, the school board\u2019s manager of technology.But putting Wi-Fi into Lisgar\u2019s Victorian-era stone structure is just the most recent attempt to update the aging building, says David Flemming, the former president of Heritage Ottawa.\u00a0\u201cToday, Lisgar is essentially a modern building within the stone shell of an older structure.\u201dIn 1975, Lisgar was gutted and renovated to bring the building into compliance with fire code. The update included an upgraded science lab, fluorescent lighting, an expanded library, and new seats and a new stage in the auditorium.\u00a0\u201cIn many ways, the installation of Wi-Fi continues the old tradition of modernizing the school,\u201d says Flemming.Because city bylaws and the Ontario Heritage Act protect only the exterior stone walls of Lisgar against major alterations, rewiring the inside of the school does not impact its heritage designation, says Miller.\u201cDespite this, we are being cautious with Lisgar anyway because it is a heritage building and you can\u2019t just slap new wires up into the ceiling without knowing what impact that might have.\u201dStudents will be allowed to bring electronic devices to class and the school will also have laptops available for students who do not have their own, says Bruce Summers, the vice-principal at Lisgar.The new technology will allow students to access tools such as online encyclopedias and websites offering interactive lessons and quizzes, says Summers.Wi-Fi allows educators to teach students digital literacy and improve their online research skills, says Summers.\u201cIf you have a science class and the teacher is talking about fructose, for instance, he or she will be able to direct students online to credible websites where they can learn more about what this word means.\u201dAnd while today\u2019s technology might be new, the push to modernize Lisgar is as old as the school itself, says David Jeanes, a Lisgar alumni who graduated in 1965.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even have computers when I was there, but Lisgar has always continued to improve its interior while keeping its heritage values and beauty intact,\u201d says Jeanes, who also gives informational walking tours on Ottawa\u2019s historical architecture.Jeanes says older schools like Lisgar must continually adapt to meet changing demands.\u201cAt one point during the Second World War, there was a rifle range on the fourth floor of Lisgar and military cadets used it for target practice because there was a real fear that war could come to Canada,\u201d says Jeanes.In other cases, auto mechanic classrooms and woodworking areas at Lisgar have been converted into performing spaces for drama classes, he says.The installation of Wi-Fi is a way of catching up with the one-third of Ottawa public schools which are already equipped with wireless Internet.\u201cWe see that there is a need for this technology, so now it is just a matter of putting it in place,\u201d says Miller.Teachers will monitor the use of electronic devices and the rules that apply to school computers will also apply to any device using the Wi-Fi networks. he says.",

Cutting the service could save Ontario $70 million, according to the report. The report was the work of former TD Bank economist Don Drummond, and includes suggestions to reduce Ontario\u2019s spending to eliminate the current\u00a0 deficit. The report suggests capping high school credits at 32, two more than required needed to graduate. It also states the province should amend the Education Act, to allow school boards to \u201ccharge a modest fee, set by the province, for each additional credit above the 32 successfully completed credit threshold.\u201dNot everyone is in favour of the proposal.Catherine Fife, president of the Ontario Public School Boards\u2019 Association, says there is no doubt in her mind about providing flexibility around a fifth year.\u201cThat fifth year provides students not only the time to mature, but also to explore the best options for them,\u201d she says.However, Bruce Summers, vice-principal of Lisgar Collegiate Institute, doesn\u2019t think the capping of 32 credits is a deal breaker for the province.\u201cMost kids who do the victory lap don\u2019t have more than 30 credits,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that they don\u2019t have 30 credits after four years.\u201dBut nine years after Grade 13 was phased out, many students still go back for a fith year.

The Ottawa Citizen reported recently that parents determined to secure a spot for their children at Lisgar may be going so far as to move downtown or purchase a property in the area to qualify for enrolment at the school without having to obtain one of the few transfer openings now available under the new rules. But school board trustee Jennifer McKenzie says she hasn\u2019t heard of any specific cases of families moving.\u201cI would suspect that given that it\u2019s such a huge financial decision, that most families would not take that decision lightly and there wouldn\u2019t be a huge number of families that were doing that,\u201d she says. The number of transfer requests certainly took a hit in the policy\u2019s first year, McKenzie added, acknowledging that the number of approved applications was similarly affected.Schools such as Hillcrest High have not been so lucky. Enrolment there has dropped drastically, forcing the school to do away with some extracurricular programming and even reduce the number of teachers.The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board passed the policy back in 2010 to limit the number of students transferring to public schools outside of their home district. Prior to the enactment of the policy, transfers were granted on a first-come, first-served basis. Lisgar, with its strong academic reputation, would sometimes see family members camp overnight in front of the school\u2019s entrance to be near the front of the line the day transfer spots were opened.\u00a0In 2010, Lisgar accepted about 80 transfer applications but turned down another 220, according to a Citizen report at the time.Now, students have a two-week period every year in which to apply to schools outside their own district. Transfers are granted at the discretion of the principal of the school in which the student wishes to enrol.\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about people moving districts, it\u2019s nothing new,\u201d says James Fraser, a former cross-district transfer student. He says that if the policy had been in place when he chose Lisgar over his district high school, his parents wouldn\u2019t have made the move downtown.Fraser says students should be able to choose the school that\u2019s right for them.The reality is that someone\u2019s community school may not be best equipped to deal with their individual needs, he says, whether such needs are French Immersion programming, an enriched program, or escaping bullies.\u201cIt is not unusual when a family is looking to buy a house to be considering the schools in the neighbourhood,\u201d McKenzie says. \u201cBut generally the curriculum is the same, and the teachers move from school to school.\u201d As the top public high school in Ottawa, as rated by the Fraser Institute, and 14th in all of Ontario, Lisgar has long been the object of many prospective students\u2019 fancy.

You need good eyesight to see it, and according to school books, it is incorrect. Instead of IV, the fourth Roman numeral on the Peace Tower clock is IIII. \r\rThat is one of many quirky stories found in Don Nixon\u2019s book, The Other Side of the Hill. The book reveals a hidden side of the Hill, one that does not have Mounties on horseback or tulips, says Nixon, a retired government engineer who spent nearly 30 years managing Parliament Hill building projects for the department of public works and government services.\u201cParliament Hill is going to be here for a long time,\u201d says Nixon. \u201cAnd these kinds of stories are a valid part of history.\u201dNixon was alerted to the odd numbering on the clock in an email sent to him by a citizen wanting to know why it was not IV. \u201cI must have looked up at it several times a day and I had never noticed it,\u201d says Nixon.For reasons unknown to the public, it is apparently a convention among some clock and watch makers to use IIII instead of IV, like Big Ben\u2019s clock in London and the Rolex watch you might be wearing.After discovering the quirky clock, Nixon, who volunteered as a tour guide for several years, says he used to quiz the public on their knowledge of Roman numerals. To no one\u2019s surprise, most replied with IV. Nixon says he then turned the quiz onto the group\u2019s watches and told them to look at the four. To everyone\u2019s surprise, there were always a couple who had IIII instead of IV.The clock, built in 1922, is a heritage site for tourists to photograph. Yet, 90 years later, most Ottawa residents do not know about the clock\u2019s fourth Roman numeral twist.\u201cYou ask me this today and I\u2019ve lived two minutes away my entire life. I must have walked by it a million times and it never dawned on me to check the numbers,\u201d says Aman Kaura, a third-year history student at the University of Ottawa who lives near Parliament Hill.Even former tour guides do not know about the numbers.\u201cI worked there for two years and I never knew about it until now,\u201d says Michelle Lauer, a former parliamentary tour guide. \u201cI\u2019m glad a book was written about it though. It probably has so many quirky stories.\u201dIn the 461-page book, Nixon writes about the discomfort politicians had to endure in the hot, smelly Centre Block during the Victorian era.It also covers the 1916 fire, where Nixon makes a bold statement by saying that it was not an accident. The book reveals a secret \u201cbar [that] politicians didn\u2019t want to admit there was,\u201d where last-call was far later than other bars. Nixon also writes about the Hill's cat colony. \u201cIt\u2019s wacky, almost bizarre. Very interesting book,\u201d says Nixon. The copper roofs on Parliament are green. Everyone can see that. But Nixon says the green did not come naturally. In his book, he quotes Doug Pickard, the foreman of a roofing contractor: \u201cRoofers used to mop horse urine on the new copper to make it go green faster.\u201dWhether a watch strikes IIII or IV, or a roof\u2019s aging process is accelerated by urine, Don Nixon\u2019s The Other Side of the Hill will give you a new view of the Hill and all of its happenings.

An old slate-roof building near the O-Train may be in jeopardy. \r\rThe Dalhousie Community Association has brought the historic Centretown building to the attention of the city in hopes of saving it.The building, located at 290 City Centre Ave., just north of Somerset Street West along Centretown\u2019s western boundary, may be affected by the city\u2019s condo development plan expected in the vacant lot between Somerset and Bayview transit station.\u201cWe\u2019re not in this to force somebody to keep it,\u201d says Eric Darwin, president of the association. \u201cWe\u2019re not in this to block development of the site.

Darwin says he would like the building to be incorporated into the redeveloped area.\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to suddenly disappear because nobody ever thought of questioning something about it,\u201d says Darwin.The building currently serves as the head office for Ottawa retail stores Pom Pom Inc. and Bank Street Framing, and has since at least 2003, according to Nick Ianiero of Bank Street Framing. The property is owned by Equity One Real Estate.But there have been many previous tenants in the century-old building. The building has been shown on maps as early as 1902 and is believed to have been built shortly after the 1900 Hull-Ottawa fire which took out most of the area surrounding LeBreton Flats, says Darwin. The building originally served as a woodworking factory. The slate roof protected it from fires, since the building was right next to a railway track which used steam engines. Other than its signature roof, citizens and passersby enjoy its scotch bond brickwork, cement or stone details, and the prominent gable of the main entrance, said David Jeanes of the board of Heritage Ottawa, in an email. But Darwin, who was unsure of the current tenants\u2019 situation, says there are many options to make the building fit with its new surroundings. For one, the new bike path which will run adjacent to the O-Train might make it sensible for the place to be turned into a bike shop. Darwin also recommended a coffee shop or a retail store.\u201cI love the contrast of the old and the new right together,\u201d says Darwin. \u201cI want the building to be used; I want it to modernized and used. I\u2019m not saying, hey you can\u2019t build around it; I\u2019m not saying you have to spend $2 million on it. It\u2019s a question of making sure we\u2019re aware of what the building is and how it could be used and how it could be repurposed.\u201dCity officials did not return calls about the development plan.",

    "body": "Richard Coelho, Centretown NewsThe buildings of the Booth Street complex, currently owned by Natural Resources Canada, have been pegged as an ideal site for Ottawa's own distillery district. Community organizations and developers are eyeing a cluster of old industrial buildings on Booth Street as an ideal site for a distillery district that could be Ottawa\u2019s version of the popular distillery neighbourhood in Toronto.\r\rThe Booth Street complex, currently owned by Natural Resources Canada, occupies several city blocks on the east side of Booth Street, north of Carling Avenue.\u00a0 The complex has 13 brick buildings with peaked roofs and paned windows. \u00a0Though alcohol was never brewed on the site as in Toronto\u2019s distillery district, the historical buildings create a similar industrial atmosphere.A spokesperson for Natural Resources Canada says the department has no plans to move out or redevelop the 10.4-hectare site anytime soon, but a report last year in the Ottawa Citizen cited an access-to-information request revealing the government may one day sell part of its holdings in the area.This possibility has residents envisioning an urban village that could one day enliven the Centretown area.\u201cYou can just picture the old buildings mixed with new, glass highrises around the parking lot and in the centre you\u2019d have this very attractive courtyard area which would be great for retail uses or a farmer\u2019s market,\u201d says Eric Darwin, the president of the Dalhousie Community Association.The site\u2019s proximity to Preston Street and Dow\u2019s Lake makes it a prime redevelopment spot, says Darwin.He adds that the size of the complex would allow for the mixture of dense urban living and outdoor pedestrian space similar to Toronto\u2019s distillery district.Toronto\u2019s version is a national historic site east of the downtown core.\u00a0 It was transformed from a collection of derelict buildings into a rejuvenated urban hub 11 years ago. \u00a0Open only to pedestrians, the tourist attraction houses businesses, art galleries, theatres, schools and condos.Similar mixed-use development would be necessary in order for a distillery district to be economically viable in Ottawa, says Lori Mellor, executive director of the Preston Street BIA.\u201cHaving a hub there would be helpful for our businesses,\u201d she says.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re desperate for retail, so we need some retail attractions here to get people to Preston Street beyond just dining.\u201dA combination of retail, office and residential space would encourage local residents to stay in the neighbourhood to shop and would also draw people in from other parts of the city.Mellor says retailers have typically been reluctant to come into the neighbourhood because of its low-income census tract, but they could be enticed if the Booth Street complex was rehabilitated.\u201cThese big plots of land are most likely to get the big retailers we need,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you get one big anchor store, that starts a rejuvenation.\u201dThe owners of the Toronto distillery district say they might be interested in buying the property if it goes up for sale.\u201cWe think there is opportunity for our company to create something that would be well received by the local community and that would certainly make living in and visiting Ottawa better,\u201d says Cityscape Holdings\u2019 marketing and media spokesman Mathew Rosenblatt.But Rosenblatt says if Cityscape Holdings does plan to build on the site, it would not recreate the same design in Ottawa.\u201cEach site is meant to be an evolution of the city itself, so we\u2019d be looking to create something that would be a reflection of Ottawa.\u201d",

    "body": "Do you hear that loud sigh? That is the sound of Ottawa Senators president Cyril Leeder and his colleagues breathing collective relief.\r\rEarlier this month, federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty nixed the provincial Liberal government\u2019s bid to cancel a corporate tax break for sports and entertainment tickets.And the provincial economy is better off for it.Ontario is coping with a $16-billion deficit, and has said that this particular corporate subsidy costs $15 million annually.Under the current rules, companies are allowed to write off 50 per cent of all live sport and concert tickets.Surely, Premier Dalton McGuinty could have picked another one of economist Don Drummond\u2019s 362 recommendations to try and reduce the deficit.Sport and tourism are effective economic drivers; putting butts in the seats and the suites is good business.Earlier this month, Leeder argued that the tax deduction was crucial to Sens ticket sales and that the franchise would flounder if the tax break were scrapped.As a small market team, Leeder said the Sens organization relies on corporate sales at Scotiabank Place \u2013 the team\u2019s home rink \u2013 to survive.Corporations currently occupy all of the arena\u2019s 120 luxury suites and account for 50 per cent of all season ticket sales.Ontario\u2019s other hockey team \u2013 the hated, yet obscenely profitable Toronto Maple Leafs \u2013 would have no trouble existing without the tax credit. The National Basketball Association\u2019s Toronto Raptors and the Major League Baseball\u2019s Toronto Blue Jays would also be able to survive the proposed cut.The Senators\u2019 profitability is on thin ice. Their $2.8 million in operating income pales in comparison to the Leafs\u2019 $81.8 million.It\u2019s too bad Warren Buffett wasn\u2019t part of Drummond\u2019s economic task force. The legendary investor could have adapted his \u2018tax the rich\u2019 budget-savings theories to save the province some money. Recommendation number 363: tax the Leafs \u2013 er \u2013 rich.For a small market team like Ottawa, sold out arenas, and sold out luxury suites in particular, are crucial to economic sustainability.When the Winnipeg Jets were resurrected this past off-season, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stressed that in order for the team to be sustainable in such a small market, it would have to sell out every box and seat for every game.Winnipeggers answered the call and have their team locked up for at least five years. But as with the Senators, any hit to corporate commitments will affect revenue and the future of the franchise.The Ottawa team is currently seventh in league attendance and is in the minority of teams that have sold more than 100 per cent of its home tickets this season, according to ESPN\u2019s 2011-2012 NHL attendance report.On top of boasting sterling attendance numbers, the Senators also have the cheapest tickets of all seven Canadian NHL teams.The organization is doing something right.The 50 per cent figure has been the source of much debate since it came to light. Opponents of the tax break would argue that taxpayers are paying for half the private box or season ticket, but that\u2019s not how it works. The actual public contribution is a lot less damaging on the books than people think.It would be interesting to learn how many people actually knew about the tax break before a couple of weeks ago. For sports fans, ignorance is bliss.If the ruling had passed, corporations might not have chosen to cancel their ticket subscriptions after all. In this sense, Leeder may have been a bit presumptuous.It\u2019s hard to sympathize with a sports franchise that rakes in millions of dollars in profit and pays its players accordingly, especially in today\u2019s fiscal climate.But it\u2019s indisputable that sports teams with committed fan support \u2013 like the Senators \u2013 bring economic development to the community. In a small market like Ottawa, the economic benefits from a sold-out arena outweigh the corporate sports and entertainment tax burden on the government\u2019s books.Hockey fan or not, Jim Flaherty helped out the Ottawa Senators organization.Score one for the little guys.",

Those who want to learn the art of running a successful business should take a lesson or two from Terry Scanlon. \r\rThirty years after he started selling hotdogs on the corner of Bank Street and Laurier Avenue, Scanlon has kept customers coming back for more.\u201cI have a great desire to be with people,\u201d says Scanlon as he waves at a familiar face. He used to be a photographer and took passport photos and pictures for wedding albums. But once his boss retired, Scanlon decided to put down his camera and bought a vending cart.\u00a0 \u00a0The long hours that keep vendors on their feet could be tiring, but Scanlon has a degenerative disc disease that doesn\u2019t allow him to sit for long periods of time. His feet swell after some time so he buys sneakers three sizes bigger. \u201cI also make my own orthopedics with foam inserts, and it feels like cushions on my feet,\u201d he says. His red and yellow cart stands out among the sea of black and grey suits in the business district of Ottawa. Virtual Tourist and Travel Advisor websites have named Scanlon\u2019s cart as the spot for best hotdogs in the city. CBC\u2019s Ottawa Morning recently paid him and his cart a visit, congratulating him on his thirtieth anniversary.\u00a0He believes he has to have quality products in order to please his customers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a fresh roll, top quality wiener, good ingredients for the top of the hotdog and a good cooking procedure,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get them to keep coming back.\u201d Mayor Jim Watson says that Scanlon is a local institution and brings credit to his profession. In an email, Watson said that Scanlon offers a \u201cgreat product with very friendly service and reasonable prices.\u201d Scanlon says raising prices and skimping on quality is not the proper way to do business. \u201cPeople are going to notice it, they\u2019re going to taste it. You\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019re happy and if it costs me a few pennies to do it, then I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he says as he heats up a juicy sausage for a customer.His approach has served him well. Scanlon has served his classic hotdogs to prime ministers, politicians and movie stars. \u201cThe finance minister, Mr. Jim Flaherty comes by and we\u2019ve had prime minister Brian Mulroney here too,\u201d shares Scanlon. Thomas McFarland lives in Orleans but comes to Scanlon\u2019s cart when he\u2019s in the city. \u201cThey\u2019re delicious so I don\u2019t mind coming all the way for these hotdogs. He smiles and chats with me while he grills them too, that\u2019s special,\u201d says McFarland.\u00a0McFarland may have to continue coming down to the city for Scanlon\u2019s hotdogs because the 67 year old has no plans of expanding his business to other parts of the city.\u201cWe\u2019re so successful with this one cart, that I don\u2019t want to stress myself out with more. I don\u2019t want to do things to my health over work,\u201d he says.His four-wheeled tin cart sits between government buildings, apartment towers and stores. He says people have no choice but to pass by his cart, and when they do, his larger-than-life personality usually attracts them to buy a hotdog or a cold beverage. If his charm doesn\u2019t reel in customers, he says, his bright yellow signs and clean vending space draw attention to his cart.\u201cSquashed old coffee cups, cigarette butts, candy wrappers, things like that, it\u2019s not good for business. We clean all that up so we have a good, comfortable and positive flow of energy going by,\u201d he says.He works 12 hours a day, six days a week, all throughout the year. He says that slow business in the winter does not stop him from showing up every morning for the daily bun delivery. Subway, Quiznos\u2019 and a chip truck down Laurier Avenue are his competition and failing to show up means losing important business. \u201cI\u2019ve known Terry for close to 20 years and I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s been around for three decades. He\u2019s a great citizen and business person that brings some real colour and character to the downtown,\u201d says Watson.Scanlon says he has always gone the extra mile to ensure success. \u201cThe customers are going to think \u2018that\u2019s a cold pop, and that hot dog is right on\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be satisfied and it\u2019s only three bucks.\u201d",

    "body": "When Ottawa Business Woman of the Year nominee Jennifer Cross graduated from Sheridan College with a degree in interior design, she had no idea she would be running a multimillion dollar company.\r\rCross is the managing partner for Premier Executive Suites and one of nine nominees in the Women\u2019s Business Network of Ottawa\u2019s (WBN) upcoming Business Woman of the Year Award.But according to statistics that surfaced thanks to the hype of International Women\u2019s Day, Cross represents a shrinking number of women who successfully take on the business world. A recent World Bank report, titled Women, Business and the Law, highlights what many see as a growing problem. The report indicates that globally, women do 66 per cent of the work, produce 50 per cent of the food, earn 10 per cent of the income and own one per cent of the property.In Canada, where the number of female adults in the work force is higher than any other G7 country, women in senior management roles are still far behind, sitting at 28 per cent this time last year according to research from Grant Thornton\u2019s International Business Report.\u00a0 As of March 8, the number has fallen to 25 per cent.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d says Erin Crotty, co-chair of the Awards and owner of a consulting firm.Crotty explains that women in business often have to blaze trails in their communities and break through a \u201cglass ceiling\u201d of stereotypes in a field that is often seen as a man\u2019s world. But Crotty remains optimistic that with support from groups such as the BWN, the numbers can improve. \u201cAs long as we continue to persevere and challenge the status quo I think we can continue to change those statistics,\u201d she says. Crotty says the Business Women of the Year award is an important recognition of successful women in Ottawa. \u201cI think one of the biggest challenges we have (as women) \u2013 and I can speak from my own experiences \u2013 is that we don\u2019t toot our own horn enough,\u201d she says.As an award nominee and Centretown resident, Cross is an excellent example of what it takes to be successful, says Crotty.Sitting up straight at her white, glass-topped desk \u2013 the centrepiece in an office filled with subtle pink and floral details \u2013 Cross explains how she went from designing rooms to managing Premier Executive Suites in Ottawa. Not one to take baby steps, she says her business career began when she started up an interior decorating store in Ottawa called Inside Out, fresh out of college.\u201cSometimes not knowing the end result and just having some guts and going for it serves you better than weighing it all out, all of the options, all of the risks,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I had known how hard it was going to be, I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it!\u201d she says, laughing.For the next eight years, Cross built a clientele and rapport with suppliers in Ottawa. But life caught up with her, she says.\u201cThe biggest challenge that women face, and specifically myself, is the balance between all of the roles that you play,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me I am a mother of two, a single mother, and so the balance of building your career as well as being there for your children is an incredibly difficult balance.\u201dRaising the children and going through a divorce forced Cross to look for more stable employment. She says it was her experience and connections from developing her business that qualified her to become a business manager with Phillip Van Leeuwen \u2013 a furniture showroom in Byward Market. After three years, she switched jobs again and became a managing partner, her current position with Premier Executive Suites. According to Kim Grimes, VP of Sales at Premier Executive Suites, Cross has been a blessing to the Ottawa branch of the company. \u201cWhen Jennifer came into the office and started here staff morale was quite low but she came in and kind of boosted the whole environment,\u201d she says.Grimes has worked under male management and says the difference between the two seems to be Cross\u2019 team-centric attitude. \u201cWomen are mothering even if they don\u2019t have kids, it is that nurturing instinct,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen Jennifer is faced with something everything is a team effort.\u201dThe awards Gala will be held April 12, 2012 at the Hampton Inn and Conference Centre in Ottawa. Grimes says she will be at the ceremony to support her boss when the winners are announced. For Cross, she says she is looking forward to hearing the stories of other women at the event.\u201cIf you read about women who built themselves from nothing it is because they believed in themselves and they didn\u2019t buy into their own circumstances,\u201d Cross says. \u201cI think that is a worldwide theme.\u201d",

    "body": "A Centretown woman who says her life was adversely affected by the loss of her pit bull companion is backing an Ottawa Valley-area MPP\u2019s bill to repeal the province\u2019s seven-year-old ban targeting the breed.\r\rRandy Hillier, Progressive Conservative MPP for Lanark-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, introduced Bill 16 in November 2011, seeking the repeal of breed-specific provincial legislation. The bill recently passed second reading in the Ontario legislature and has won significant support from all three parties.The ban was implemented by the Ontario Liberal government in March 2005 following a series of high-profile attacks in the preceding year involving dogs identified as pit bulls.In one incident, three pit bulls jumped a fence and attacked a two-year-old boy as he and his father walked through a park in Ottawa. The boy\u2019s father and a passer-by managed to beat the animals away, but were badly bitten while doing so.It was one of a number of incidents which put public and media pressure on the government of Premier Dalton McGuinty to find a solution.Hillier says while the incidents were unfortunate and unusual, government should find solutions based upon solid facts and science, not upon public hysteria.He says there is technically no such breed as pit bulls, which he describes as a collective term for a number of breeds, including the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, Argentine Dogo, and others. However, the law fails to identify these specific breeds, says Hillier.This means there is no scientific or practical means of defining the breed the ban targets, and leaves the law subject to the interpretation of those who enforce it, which is unfair, he insists.\u201cIt does not provide any remedy or recourse for those who are alleged to have dogs that appear to be a pit bull, and it can\u2019t be considered lawful,\u201d says Hillier. \u201cIf somebody seizes (a) dog, because it\u2019s got short, brown hair, the onus is on (the owner) to prove it is not something the bylaw enforcement person says it is.\u201dLiberal MPP Kim Craitor agrees. The member from Niagara-Fort Erie drew enthusiastic applause from the opposition when he, along with two other Liberals, voted for Bill 16. Despite not personally supporting the ban, he said he voted with the McGuinty government in passing the measure in 2005 because of the media pressure at the time.\u201cI was not a supporter of the bill when it was first introduced,\u201d says Craitor. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really go into the legislation to make the dog owner accountable . . . We kind of just said there\u2019s only one kind of dog that bites, so that kind of dog doesn\u2019t belong in Ontario.\u201dThe Ottawa Humane Society does not support breed-specific legislation, and says the number of dog-bite incidents in the region have remained steady since the ban was introduced.\u201cThere are many reasons that could contribute to dangerousness in a dog, including poor training, mistreatment; breed doesn\u2019t have as much an impact as these other factors,\u201d says Ottawa Humane Society spokesperson Mandy Chepeka.Following the dissolution of her marriage last summer, Centretown resident Ashley Paquette relied on her dog, Jack, for emotional support. She lived in the United States at the time.When Paquette decided to move back to Ottawa in August 2011, where she grew up, Jack could not come with her, because he was classified as a pit bull.\u201cHe was an amazing, wonderful dog, and I had to give him up, because he couldn\u2019t live in Ontario with me,\u201d says Paquette, 23. \u201cIt was probably the most devastating thing of my life, and, absolutely, the hardest decision I ever had to make.\u201dStill, Willowdale Liberal MPP David Zimmer defended the ban in debate on Feb. 24, arguing it was reasonable given the protection it provided Ontarians.\u201cWe saw photographs, medical reports of children with their face torn off, adults with their genitalia chewed off,\u201d said Zimmer, before being cut off by the legislative assembly\u2019s raucous reaction.Hillier dismissed Zimmer\u2019s comments as hysteria. He says more and more citizens believe the ban is wrong, and that the right decisions need to be made.Bill 16 is currently before a standing committee at the Ontario legislature, before it is to be brought to the assembly for a third reading and final vote, where it will become law if passed.",

The vice can be anything from junk food, to TV, to Facebook. \u00a0The point is to help people appreciate just how hard people with addictions work to become clean and sober, says the recovery program\u2019s executive director, Jackie Lloyd-Rai. \u00a0\u201cPeople with addictions are really not much different from other people with bad habits,\u201d Lloyd-Rai says. \u201cThey just lose control of them.\u201d \u00a0This year, the fundraiser\u2019s goal is set at $10,000.The program gets provincial funding, but must fundraise to cover extras.Vesta is housed in a grand four-storey home on James Street.\u00a0 It combines a daily schedule of chores, classes and therapy groups.Last year, Lloyd-Rai says she took the modest $1,000 proceeds from the first, tentative edition of Victory Over Vice and used them to establish the Tree House project.

Two local athletes are training to compete in the 2012 Abu Dhabi Combat Club (ADCC) Submission Wrestling World Championships in Abu Dhabi next month. \r\rBoth Joel Hadden and Brandon McGourty won their divisions at the ADCC pro trials event in Montreal to qualify. Not only did they qualify, but they will also receive an all expenses paid trip to compete in one of the world\u2019s most prestigious grappling events from April 13-15. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge tournament,\u201d says Hadden. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see Abu Dhabi from a tourist point of view and obviously the tournament is going to be an unreal experience.\u201dIt\u2019s been a long year for Hadden, who came up short in his attempts to qualify last year, losing by official decision to the eventual champion.\u201cI was that close, one decision away,\u201d says Hadden. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked all year to correct those mistakes, competed a lot more frequently, and this year I\u2019ve got a lot more experience under my belt.\u201dMcGourty has also had a tough path to Abu Dhabi. Although this was his first attempt to qualify, his final opponent outweighed him by about 100 pounds. In jiu-jitsu tournaments there are weight classes, but there is usually an absolute division, which includes the winners at each weight. Fighting a bigger opponent can be difficult, but McGourty says jiu-jitsu is about a lot more than pure strength.\u201cJiu-jitsu can work for the smaller guy if you can use leverage and technique to your advantage,\u201d says McGourty. \u201cBut if a big guy knows jiu-jitsu it can be really tough.\u201dWhat makes their accomplishments even more impressive is the fact that they\u2019ve only been competing for a little over a year. Both McGourty and Hadden began training in jiu-jitsu about three years ago, saying they originally started because they were interested in mixed martial arts. But as soon as they started jiu-jitsu they fell in love with it and decided to focus on a single discipline.

    "body": "Anybody who has played organized hockey has heard it before. \r\rPatrick Burke calls it \u201ccasual homophobia.\u201dIt\u2019s intended to be a joke amongst teammates when they\u2019re sitting in the locker room, or an insult to opposing players.That language has forced gay hockey players at all levels to shy away from being candid about their sexuality.It\u2019s exactly what the Philadelphia Flyers scout is trying to eliminate from the NHL. That is why he created the You Can Play project, which was launched with a public service announcement on March 4, during a game between the New York Rangers and Boston Bruins.The project aims to carry on the message inspired by his late brother Brendan, who was tragically killed in a car accident in February of 2010, three months after announcing he was gay. At the time, Brendan Burke was a student manager with the Miami University hockey team.His announcement marked the first time anybody directly involved in high-level hockey had openly discussed his homosexuality. It was a landmark moment his family is trying to carry forward.According to the organization, You Can Play aims to \u201cchange the sometimes homophobic culture of locker rooms with a message that athletes should be judged on athletic skill and ability, not sexual orientation or other discriminatory factors.\u201dBy starting this campaign, Patrick Burke has taken the first big step towards erasing a problem that has hampered the sporting world for far too long.With roughly 30 NHL players supporting the cause so far, a solid foundation has been formed.But without an openly gay athlete at the highest level of professional hockey, the message could fall upon deaf ears.With one, Flyers winger Wayne Simmonds might not have alledgely yelled a homophobic slur towards Rangers pest Sean Avery during a 2011 pre-season game. If there were an openly gay player in the league, Simmonds would not degrade him by using that language so carelessly.Maybe then the league would start cracking down on these incidents. Simmonds was not suspended for his action. The NHL is one of the slowest leagues in the world to react and change with the times. After all, it still has not banned headshots, despite an alarming concussion issue in recent years.Unless a homosexual athlete is seen to have the same ability as any straight hockey player, the sad fact is this campaign will not produce the necessary change.Burke thinks that will happen within the next two years. For the sake of the project, it needs to. The league needs a prominent face if the stigma surrounding gay athletes is to be removed. Without one, NHLers will continue to believe that only the most macho individuals can succeed in the sport. The reason Jackie Robinson was able to break the colour barrier in baseball was simple; he was talented. Robinson was an MVP-calibre ball player who made six all-star teams during his MLB career.As Patrick Burke would say, he could play.Racial equality would have happened eventually in baseball, but Robinson\u2019s talent helped speed up a process that was long overdue.Sixty-five years later, the NHL finds itself in a very similar position with homophobia.An openly gay player with an average skillset would be an incredible step forward. One with superstar status could change the lives of kids everywhere who are afraid to come out, living in fear of being ridiculed by teammates.For a hockey team to succeed, chemistry in the dressing room is critical. Those who disrupt that chemistry are often traded away because they created tension amongst the group.If someone in the NHL embraces Burke\u2019s message right now, gay athletes everywhere would no longer need to worry about being kicked out of that group. It\u2019s almost as important as the play on the ice; every player wants to be accepted as \u2018one of the boys.\u2019 Those boys are expected to be many things. From a young age, physical strength is at the top of that list.If a current NHL player came out and openly embraced his homosexuality, he would be the strongest of all, and the league could finally welcome itself into the 21st century.",

The Ottawa 67\u2019s have struck a deal with the Ottawa Senators, allowing the team to relocate to\u00a0 Scotiabank Place for the next two seasons while construction on the Lansdowne Park redevelopment is underway. \r\rThe move from the Ottawa Civic Centre to Scotiabank Place is contingent on the city\u2019s approval of the redevelopment of Lansdowne Park. If the project is finally approved in the upcoming months, as is expected, the construction will be completed in 2014. \u201cLansdowne is going to be a warzone during construction,\u201d says Randy Burgess, vice-president of the 67\u2019s. \u201cStaying at the Civic Centre just wasn\u2019t the best option for the fans.\u201d But the relocation has left many loyal 67\u2019s fans unhappy. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d says Adrian O\u2019Donnell, who has been a 67\u2019s season ticket holder since 1990. \u00a0O\u2019Donnell\u2019s problem with the 67\u2019s move to Kanata is about more than the change in location of home ice, which will no longer a short walk away from his Glebe home. O\u2019Donnell is worried about the scheduling, and whether he will still be able to bring his two young children to the games. Because the 67\u2019s have priority over ice time at the Civic Centre, their home games are regularly scheduled for Friday nights and Sunday afternoons. But now, it\u2019s the Ottawa Senators that will have priority \u2013 making it more difficult for the 67\u2019s to have consistently scheduled games. \u201cIf the team has a lot of games during the week throughout the season, I won\u2019t be able to take my kids,\u201d says O\u2019Donnell. \u201cSeason tickets wouldn\u2019t be worth it for me then.\u201d Burgess says scheduling will be a challenge, but he is confident the final schedule will be as accommodating as possible. \u201cThe organization that puts together the NHL's schedule also puts together the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that our schedule will look close to what we have now.\u201d \u00a0Patty Whais, a 67\u2019s season ticket holder, is concerned about the change in atmosphere at Scotiabank Place. \u201cJeff Hunt and the 67\u2019s have done such a great job creating a fun, family atmosphere in the Civic Centre,\u201d says Whais. \u201cI just hope it can be maintained in Scotiabank Place.\u201d O\u2019Donnell agrees, but he thinks it will be more difficult in such a big arena. \u201cIf there are 4,000 people packed into the Civic Centre for a game, you have a very rowdy crowd,\u201d says O\u2019Donnell. \u201cBut 4,000 people in Scotiabank Place is considerably dead.\u201d While the 67\u2019s are not forecasting larger crowds for next season, the organization is hopeful it will be able to attract new fans based on its new location at Scotiabank Place.\u201cThe move provides us with an opportunity to reach a new audience,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cNow, it will be easier for people from Kanata, Stittsville, Smiths Falls, Almonte and other places to come see some OHL hockey.\u201d The 67\u2019s are also planning on utilizing OC Transpo\u2019s 400-series buses, which would run from various locations across the city to Scotiabank Place on game nights, That would make it easier for fans to get to games. Burgess says moving the 67\u2019s to Scotiabank Place is the best option, for both the organization and the fans. Scotiabank Place\u2019s state of the art technology, including its new scoreboard, will help accommodate the team\u2019s sponsors better than before. As for the fans, Burgess says they will still get a great experience. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf you want to provide an entertaining atmosphere within the City of Ottawa, Scotiabank Place is your best option,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cWe understand it will be a challenge for many fans to see the team at Scotiabank Place, but we\u2019ll do all we can to make it easy for them, and hope to see them again when we return to the Civic Centre.\u201d\u00a0 ",

A local horticulturalist is urging downtown Ottawa residents to maintain an urban garden with a \u201ccrops-in-pots\u201d approach to growing plants.\r\rAbout 50 gardeners attended Edythe Falconer\u2019s presentation at city hall recently. She demonstrated how people can grow not only flowers and vines, but also their own herbs and vegetables in containers.\u201cIf you get some of this stuff growing in neat-looking pots and different colours and shapes, there is a bit of art in it,\u201d says Falconer. \u201cEnjoy yourself, don\u2019t feel guilty if some things don\u2019t work out. It is a learning process, and go for the glamour part of it.\u201dFalconer joined the Master Gardeners of Ottawa-Carleton after retiring as an Ottawa school principal 12 years ago. The group is committed to educating home gardeners through workshops and seminars. The demand for workshops on urban gardening over the past five years is one of the biggest changes she has seen in Ottawa since her retirement, says Falconer, who gives at least five seminars annually on growing plants in pots.The Centretown Citizens Community Association\u2019s trees and green space committee invited Falconer to give her presentation after several Centretown residents expressed a desire to learn more. Committee chairperson Bonnie Mabee says it\u2019s difficult to find land in Centretown that is suitable for gardens. She says increasingly dense residential construction, and the concrete and asphalt surfaces that dominate downtown Ottawa, are to blame. \u201cGrowing in containers is a valid and viable option for people living here,\u201d she says.Willi Wahl, who lives in a duplex near the intersection of Gladstone and Bronson avenues and attended the recent workshop, says he\u2019s rediscovering his love for agriculture as he nears retirement. He says gardening in his residence will be important for him to eat healthier food, remain physically active and in touch with life after he retires.Wahl grew up on a farm near Red Deer, Alta. He moved to Ottawa in 1981 and finds that highrises block out the sunlight, which gardens need. \u201cYou have really got to find little niches and nooks and places where you can squirrel away some greenery,\u201d he says.Falconer\u2019s presentation was the first time he came to such an event, he says, adding that meeting other gardeners has advantages over looking up information on the Internet. \u201cThey\u2019ll see something in your expression, in your composure, something in your body language and it will twig something in them,\u201d says Wahl. \u201cThey\u2019ll take you off in another direction where you hadn\u2019t have thought of looking, or wouldn\u2019t have gone before.\u201d As for container gardening, Falconer says there are three classifications of plants she recommends for a floral arrangement. The thriller is the tallest plant of the three and the eye-catcher. The filler is a smaller plant that leaves no large open space between growth, and the spiller hangs over the pot. People starting out on a balcony should begin with herbs, small potatoes, and the dwarf variety of any trees or shrubs, she says.Falconer also prefers to use organic soils and fertilizers. She likens modern agricultural practices to a mining operation in which the focus is on extraction rather than sustainability. But she will sometimes use chemical products to get the results she wants, she says. \u201cThe most important thing is to not feel that you have to take a book and follow everything it says,\u201d says Falconer. \u201cThe goal is to enjoy, to have something nice to eat and something nice to look at.\u201d",

She took over from Barbara Clubb at the beginning of this month, She says the first priority is implementing radio frequency identification (RFID), a mechanism for checking out and checking in several books at a time.\u201cIt\u2019s a way of automating our library,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cRight now, you would go into a library, borrow a book, and when you bring it back to the book return, someone has to take it out and then process it before it is processed from your account.\u201d Jennifer Stirling, OPL\u2019s division manager, is in charge of system wide services and innovation. She explains that in order for RFID to work, books must have a \u201clittle tag\u201d on the back cover, which lets the system process several books at a time. This allows people to return books, and have them processed automatically right away, which could help avoid late fees. Instead of spending time scanning barcodes, \u201cour staff can spend more time serving customers, answering questions, and help you with that research that you have,\u201d McDonald says. The first branch that is looking at obtaining books with RFID tags is the library\u2019s Hazeldean branch. Stirling says that she hopes all of Ottawa\u2019s libraries will implement the system within seven years. A second change that McDonald is leading is the development and purchase of virtual desktop infrastructure. \u201cWe have public desktops at the moment,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cEvery computer has its own desktop and monitor \u2026 You have the box, then you have the monitor.\u201d Virtual desktop infrastructure eliminates the need for a \u201cbox\u201d at each computing station. This saves space allowing for more computers. But with technological changes come challenges, says McDonald. One is the unfamiliarity of staff and clients with the new technology. Training for staff will be rigorous to minimize the impact of this challenge, she adds. Leading the library means that she will be much busier than before, she says, but is looking forward to learning new things. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun part of any new job.\u201dMcDonald says that her appointment is a \u201ccareer highlight\u201d and that she is looking forward to leading the library for a long time.

Christina Marchant, the centre\u2019s director of community health promotion, says the plan reflects the needs of the vulnerable \u201cpriority groups\u201d such as immigrants and the GLBTQ community, which the centre focuses on helping. Marchant says the plan's ideas on breastfeeding, healthy schools, the cost of eating, and community gardening are of particular importance to Centretown.\u201cWe\u2019ve got four community gardens in the Centretown area. With densification of housing, access to greenspace becomes important. Community gardening is a great way to boost greenspace and healthy food,\u201d says Marchant, noting that the centre works with many low-income people who struggle to pay for healthy food.One of the health centre's approaches to the issue is its Good Food Box, a project which provides local produce at low prices. People who do not have a lot of expendable income can get healthy, local food without taking a handout. Marchant says it is the centre\u2019s \u201cnon-charitable\u201d approach to increasing access to nutritional food. Working toward a similar goal is the Ottawa branch of Community Harvest, an Ontario-wide program which works with farmers to collect crops for their local food banks. Program coordinator Jason Gray says he, along with more than 200 volunteers, harvested 57,000 pounds of produce last year which went to feed the hungry.The CCHC will also be hosting a series of meetings until April 22 to get input from the community for the final version of the food action plan. Marchant says she sees the kitchen table talks as both being beneficial and a good way to promote involvement in local issues.\u201cWe've strived to be very open to people getting involved,\u201d says Food for All organizer Erin Krekoski. The organizations leading the plan are trying to get as broad a feedback as possible, she adds.

Melissa Vong and Reagan Yu were recently presented with the winning bicycles in the \u201cLike my Helmet\u201d contest, in which local youth posted pictures of themselves online wearing helmets while rollerblading, cycling, skating or snowboarding. Public health nurse trainee Caitlyn Scott co-ordinated the contest. She says the key to encouraging helmet use among youth is to make it cool and trendy, so using social media to get the message out was a natural next step. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that we engaged youth through social media on helmet use and we really just wanted to raise the profile of the issue and get their attention\u201d Scott says. Nancy Langdon, a supervisor at Ottawa Public Health, is confident that using social media sites such as Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook will improve the promotion of helmet use across the city. She\u2019s also excited but tight-lipped about an upcoming project that will also use social media and form a key part of OPH\u2019s helmet-promotion strategy.The agency is also working on partnership activities with the city\u2019s parks and recreation department. The \u201cYouth on the Move\u201d program will be sending young workers to skateboard parks across the city to encourage helmet use. While there are bylaws that require young ice skaters and cyclists to wear helmets, there is no similar policy for skateboarders.Langdon says that promoting helmet use among skateboarders presents a particular challenge, but hopes the \u201cYouth on the Move\u201d program will help with that. This summer will also see Ottawa Pubic Health promoting CAN-BIKE, a program designed to teach cyclists about safety on the road. There are plans to make the program available at a reduced cost to cyclists in the community. A secondary focus for OPH this spring will be stressing the importance of wearing helmets properly. Langdon says Ottawans need to make sure they use a helmet that is properly fitted and designed for their particular sport. \u00a0Bay Coun. Mark Taylor, chair of the community and protective services committee, says there has been a growing push on helmet safety in the past several years. He says the majority of head injuries that that are sports related happen to youth.\u00a0\u201cIf you can get to human beings when they\u2019re young and encourage a certain kind of behaviour, chances are they\u2019ll carry that behaviour with them into adult hood,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of building a safer tomorrow by getting to the kids of today.\u201d",

Mulcair has secured more than 30 per cent of delegates' first-choice votes after the initial ballot. Dewar had named MP Charlie Angus (Timmins-James Bay) as his potential deputy, but he since has endorsed Mulcair for leader.\"Mulcair is the other person who can lead this country,\" Angus told reporters. \"In my region, Timmins-James Bay people are very engaged with the NDP. Paul Dewar had a lot of support in my region . . . I heard some people who said 'if Paul Dewar doesn't make it, (Mulcair) is our vote back home'.\" Nova Scotia pharmacist Martin Singh had perviously announced he was swinging his supporters to Mulcair, potentially giving the Ouebec MP a further 4,000 first-choice ballots and more than 35 per cent of the total first-choice vote.Although Dewar could not immediately be reached for comment, his former deputy Angus told reporters he conducted himself well in the race.\"We ran a great ground game. . . Paul did a great show yesterday,\" Angus said. \"I think Paul had what it took to be Prime Minister but I don't second guess the delegates. He made the right choice.\"Dewar will not be endorsing any other candidate for the leadership, instead advising his supporters to \"make their own decision,\" according to Dewar's spokesperson, Kiavash Najafi.MP Niki Ashton (Churchill) was forced out of the race after placing last out of the seven leadership candidates. The first ballot uses a preferential balloting system, where party members ranked their choice for leader in order, from seventh to first.Mulcair increased his share of the leadership vote to more than 38 per cent after the second round of voting. Fellow candidates Brian Topp and Nathan Cullen trail him with 25 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Fourth placed candidate Peggy Nash was forced out of the race, garnering 17 per cent of the vote.",

Dewar stopped short of endorsing a competitor, but freed his supporters to make their own choice for leader.\"I thought it was important to let people go where they wanted to.\"His right-hand man, MP Charlie Angus (Timmins-James Bay) swiftly endorsed leadership candidate Thomas Mulcair.\"Mulcair is the other person who can lead this country,\" Angus told reporters. \"In my region, Timmins-James Bay people are very engaged with the NDP.

He was and is a great guy,\u201d said the Brian Topp supporter.Interim NDP leader Nycole Turmel declined to comment on Dewar specifically, but she said that the system of voting left three \u201cfully bilingual\u201d candidates on the table \u2013 Nathan Cullen, Brian Topp, and frontrunner Thomas Mulcair.\u201cWe had seven great candidates (at first ballot) and I can work with any of them. It\u2019s up to the membership to choose which of them is the best to represent the party.\u201d said Turmel.Dewar said he was \"never hiding\" the fact that his French was still a work in progress.He said he thought that MPs and party supporters would be able to see beyond his still-improving French language skills.\"I had my Quebec colleagues come on board who thought \u2018it\u2019s good enough and he\u2019ll be able to carry our party and not only keep Quebec but grow outside'.\"After announcing his bid for the party's leadership, Dewar enlisted the aid of a French language tutor. The tutor traveled with him across the country on the six-month campaign.\"I made great progress throughout and earned a lot of respect from people,\" Dewar said. In the end, his hard work failed to convince enough of the 131,000 party members across the country to select him as leader.",

    "body": "\u201cA little hope is effective. A lot of hope is dangerous. A spark is fine, as long as it\u2019s contained.\u201d\r\rThe Hunger GamesDirected by Gary Ross.Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley.President Snow (Donald Sutherland) thus explains the annual Hunger Games to his gamemaker Seneca (Wes Bentley), MC of the 74th edition, even as two dozen adolescent \u201cTributes\u201d prepare themselves athletically and cosmetically for participation in a gladiatorial death match, their only hope to be the sole survivor and winner.Based on the first installment of Suzanne Collins\u2019s best-selling young adult trilogy, The Hunger Games depicts a post-apocalyptic North America in which 12 impoverished districts surround the capital of Panem (as in panem et circenses, the political strategy of diverting the populace with entertainment).Every year, each district randomly selects a boy and a girl to participate in the games in a tradition combining Shirley Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lottery\u201d with Battle Royale by way of modern media saturation. After the youth are fed, feted, and paraded before the people of the capital, they murder each another in droves on live TV.The spark in this case is Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a delegate from District 12 who notably volunteered herself in place of her younger sister. Outshining her home-district compatriot, the earnest Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), Katniss is independent and skilled with a bow, having provided for her family since her father\u2019s death in a coal-mine explosion left her mother semi-catatonic.Katniss has the physical grace of athleticism, her good looks (though they belie that titular hunger), and the notoriety of having volunteered, all of which count in her favour, since anything that makes her memorable aids her survival by attracting the largesse of wealthy \u201csponsors,\u201d who can transmit gifts of medicine or tools to favoured Tributes in the arena.Her kind-hearted stylist, Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), cleverly outfits her with fiery special effects for her public appearances leading up to the games, earning her acclaim as \u201cthe girl on fire\u201d and halfway literalizing the spark metaphor as Katniss seems partly to transcend the geographical partisanship of the games, for instance sharing an elegiac moment with the people of District 11 after the death of their tribute Rue (Amandla Stenberg).Katniss and Peeta\u2019s strategic mentor, dedicated inebriate Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), victor of the 50th Hunger Games, discerns an opportunity to shape the narrative of the games and grip the audience even more powerfully: the \u201cstar-crossed lovers\u201d angle, with one doomed to die.Even surrounded by seasoned heavyweights, lead actors Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson shine brightest as the self-sufficient survivor and her ardent comrade, handily elevating material that could have played like niche-targeted teen melodrama in the wrong hands.Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks overplay their introductory scenes but redeem themselves as the story progresses. Lenny Kravitz, Donald Sutherland, and Wes Bentley are simply given nothing to do, while Stanley Tucci is largely wasted on an announcer role, though he shines when interacting with our heroes.But while Katniss and Peeta sort out how much of their relationship is performance and survival instinct versus adjusting to and enjoying one another, the film loses sight of its central dystopian themes and then descends into PG-13 chaos for the lengthy climax.The buildup, dwelling on combatants\u2019 training and primping, is overlong to the point that The Hunger Games, 142 minutes in all, seems to want to win viewers over through sheer attrition. The actual beginning of the games, which should be the most riveting scene of all, is poorly choreographed, lazily shot, and badly scored.\u201cTracker jackers,\u201d a cutesy plot device in the form of GMO killer bees, are up there with the very worst of Harry Potter, while the gamemaster\u2019s ability to conjure devil dogs out of thin air takes the \u201cplaying god\u201d conceit (as in The Truman Show, The Condemned, and others) to new and inexplicable heights.Haymitch\u2019s drunken introduction and scenes of jovially gloating tween murderers are starkly incongruous with the overall tone of The Hunger Games, and they are matched by as many contradictions in logic throughout.Why does nobody but Katniss use flashy effects for attention? Why are the \u2018obstacles\u2019 so uninspired after 74 years of this tradition? Why is a brief \u2013 and disturbingly racialized \u2013 riot over a dead child presented as if it is something novel after all that time? How does watching your children die instill hope?Director Gary Ross (of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit) may not have been the best candidate for the material, but in matter-of-factly presenting a capable female protagonist who navigates traditional male action-movie terrain without any gimmickry or explicit politics, The Hunger Games upholds a healthy, positive feminism devoid of trite, tit-for-tat gender reversals.Slick and sincere in execution, The Hunger Games is nevertheless a mixed bag best taken as a showcase for the actors due to its myriad inconsistencies and an unrewarding, somewhat incomprehensible ending that neither wraps up loose ends nor teases a sequel, though Catching Fire is certain to follow.",

If workers accept the agreement, their salaries will increase by 2 per cent per year from 2012-14 and 2.25 per cent in 2015. The new deal would also reopen the OC Transpo garage on Merivale by fall 2012.The union and the city reached the agreement Saturday, the same day the previous agreement was set to expire. Both sides agreed to a one-year extension of the previous agreement in September 2011, according to a news release from the city. Negotiations over a long-term deal began in January, the release states.\u2028The deal also includes changes to policies related to sick leave, uniforms, job security and driver scheduling. If the agreement is ratified, workers will be able to use six days of sick leave per year without requiring a medical certificate and can bank up to 12 sick days for future use. The new contract would also provide golf shirts for drivers to wear as part of their summer uniforms, flashlights for drivers and messengers, prescription safety glasses for equipment workers, and an increased annual clothing allowance. The deal would also create working groups for issues related to job security and driver scheduling.OC Transpo workers have the option of attending a meeting Thursday at the Civic Centre to find out more about the agreement. Union members can then vote to ratify the offer between 8 a.m. April 10 and 7:59 a.m. April 11. In December 2008, OC Transpo workers went on strike for nearly two months after contract negotiations failed between the union and the city. ",

Included in this cut is a cancellation of the $60 million annual top up the corporation received last year. In an internal conference call, CBC President Hubert Lacroix\u00a0said that reductions of the size announced in the budget cannot be accomplished without cutting services. Kirstine Stewart, head of English language services, said that some people in the English services have already been notified that they are no longer needed. Lacroix said the total financial pressure facing the CBC is $200 million, as rent is escalating across the country and the government has pulled out of covering some of those costs. \u201cWe expect to be able to offset that with $50 million in new revenues, which leaves us with about $150 million to account for by way of reductions and operating improvements,\u201d Lacroix said in a statement. The majority of cuts will be done at the national network, with only 19 per cent of the job cuts happening at the regional networks. \u2028The CBC operates out of a large complex at 181 Queen Street. Job loss information for the Ottawa location was not available.The CBC has already asked the CRTC for permission to add advertising and sponsorship to two of its national networks, Radio 2 and Espace Musique.Lacroix said ads are not being considered on Radio One because the CBC wants to \u201cpreserve the integrity of these services.\u201dThe CBC is also planning on shutting down analogue television transmitters earlier than planned. \u201cIn Canada, only 1.7\u00a0per cent of the population still receives our television signals via an analogue, over-the-air transmitter,\u201d said Lacroix. \u201cGiven these circumstances, we\u2019ve decided to accelerate our exit from this technology.\u201dOther measures the CBC is taking is are renting more space in their broadcasting centre in Toronto, killing Brazilian and Russian news bulletins on Radio Canada International and hiking employees\u2019 pension plan contributions to save $5 million.

City staff will look into moving the Downtown East station further east.In addition, private businesses would be permitted to build a pedestrian walkway to the station if it is possible, with private dollars covering the cost.\u201cA station should serve every individual person, not just O\u2019Connor or Elgin,\u201d says Sam Elsaadi, chairperson of the Sparks Street merchant association. \u201cSo at least now (councillors) consider doing something in the middle way, which is good.\u201dElsaadi owns La Mode hair salon at the east end of Sparks Street. Business owners along Sparks and Elgin streets had been upset with an earlier city decision to scrap an entrance at the National Arts Centre that would have led to Rideau Station.\u00a0This happened when it was controversially decided to move the station east from under the canal to the Rideau Centre to reduce construction costs and increase ridership in Lowertown, Sandy Hill and the Byward Market.The new motions approved at city hall surfaced after Lord Elgin Hotel owner Jeff Gillin \u2013 one of many area business people upset over the scrapped NAC stop \u2013 offered the city $2 million toward the construction of a station entrance at Confederation Square. His letter to Mayor Jim Watson and councillors also asked for a 30-day deferral on the vote to move Rideau Station so other interested parties could be contacted.Coun. Diane Deans, chair of the transit commission, NAC officials, Watson\u2019s chief of staff, Serge Arpin, and the Lord Elgin\u2019s Gillin met the night before the council meeting to come up with a solution. The 30-day deferral was dropped and the idea of a pedestrian walkway developed.\u201cEveryone was in agreement that this would be a workable solution in everyone\u2019s interest,\u201d Deans said at city council.\u201cI hope others will also look at the buildings downtown and their own opportunities for linking into the LRT system,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously the more links we have the better for the community, the better for the users, the better for businesses, better for the whole system.\u201dAt council, Watson was adamant that the city would not spend money on overlapping stations.

    "body": "Islam OttawaAn illustration of the proposed Islam Care Centre at 312 Lisgar St. Despite public concerns over a rise in parking congestion, city council approved re-zoning amendments last week to allow for the expansion of the Islam Care Centre.\r\rThe centre, located at 312 Lisgar St., is commonly referred to as the Da\u2019wah Centre. The building houses a prayer and learning space that has served the Muslim community in Ottawa\u2019s downtown core for over a decade. The centre has received approval to demolish the 100-year-old semi-detached building to make way for a four-storey building that would expand the centre\u2019s existing functionality.However, these proposed renovations would not meet the zoning bylaw provisions for the lot. As a result of the zoning amendments, the Islam Care Centre has been exempted from several requirements. Among these exemptions is a waiver on the parking space normally required at a place of worship or community health and resource centre. The lot at 312 Lisgar is too small to accommodate any parking.\u00a0 The city decided that surrounding street parking could handle any traffic to the Islam Care Centre. However, public consultations on the re-zoning process revealed significant concerns about an increase in street parking in the area.Raed Arab is the project manager for the new building and is on the board of directors for the centre. He believes there will be no additional strain on street parking.\u201cThe size of our prayer spaces is not what is going to change,\u201d says Arab. \u201cMost of our employees will be bussing in, so the extra space only requires about seven extra spots.\u201d Arab says the centre is paying the city a fee in lieu of providing adequate parking, a common practice for small, narrow lots with little space. In the proposed redevelopment, the first floor will serve as a prayer space. The second floor will be an information centre and library, while the new third and fourth floors will serve as a family services centre for the Muslim community. Arab expects the final details of the renovation to be completed within sixth months to a year. Sulaiman Khan, a founding member of the Islam Care Centre, says the focus has been on community fundraising to raise the estimated $4 million cost needed to change the centre\u2019s dilapidated structure.\u201cWe are working on projects that will get the Muslim community more involved, but we need to provide not just a place to pray but a place also for social and recreational activities,\u201d says Khan. According to Statistics Canada, the Muslim community is Canada\u2019s fastest growing religious population. The 2006 to 2031 projection of Canadian diversity report states \u201cit is the Muslim population that could show the greatest increase between 2006 and 2031, with its numbers tripling during this period.\u201dIn Ottawa, the Muslim community is very diverse, ranging in origin from East Africa to the Middle East to Southern Asia.Khan says there is a serious need for a private worship space and community centre in Ottawa that addresses social issues specific to Muslim youth.Adam Gilani, president of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Muslim Student Association, says Muslim youth face particular risk factors because their unique health and family needs often go underserved. \u00a0\u201cWhat we need is something that is operated within the Muslim community with experts and health providers . . . that know the issues better,\u201d says Gilani.

    "body": "Thirteen of the city\u2019s 15 citizen advisory committees could be merged or eliminated in a bid to improve city governance, according to city officials working on a report expected to be published later this spring. \r\rRick O\u2019Connor, the city clerk and solicitor, and Leslie Donnelly, the deputy city clerk, have been attending committee meetings to hear from members before publishing their report aimed at streamlining the city\u2019s current advisory committee structure. The report is expected to provide city council with various recommendations, including using task forces, summits or roundtables instead of the current committee structure, said a staff report published in November 2010. The report will also look at new approaches to improve citizen engagement including using technology such as social media. Part of the problem, says Donnelly, is that committees are not sticking to their mandates. \u201cThe number of agenda items relating directly to their core function range from about eight per cent to 60 per cent with the average committee spending less than a third of their time on items related to their mandate.\u201d She says committees often discuss issues, such as hydro or labour negotiations, over which city council has no authority. Despite this, committee chairs argue they provide city council and staff with free expertise for which it might otherwise have to pay. \u201cI think we provide good value to the city and we offer expert advice that is free,\u201d says Michael Powell, chair of the roads and cycling advisory committee. \u201cWhen you start considering mergers I think you need think about whether the specialization of each committee confers a certain benefit that might be lost when you have a broader focus,\u201d he says.However, some advisory groups say merging makes sense because the city has not conducted a thorough review of the advisory committee structure since amalgamation. \u00a0\u201cI think it would be advantageous to look at the feasibility of merging advisory committees so we can focus our work more comprehensively and work more directly with chairs of the standing committees that we report to,\u201d says Carol Lever, chair of the health and social services advisory committee. Donnelly says a major area of frustration is that city staff is using advisory committees as a form of public consultation.However, advisory committees see themselves as citizen experts who should be consulted early on in any policy discussion. As a result, councillors rarely attend the monthly meetings anymore, she says.In the past, two councillors would usually attend every meeting. Directed by city council, O\u2019Connor and Donnelly have asked committees to take a step back and look at what is and is not working for them. \u201cWe are asking [committees] to look at themselves and ask whether this is the best forum to provide advice to council,\u201d Donnelly said during a rural issues advisory committee meeting.While neither will speculate on which committees are likely to change, by law the accessibility advisory committee will continue to provide advice to city council and staff. The Ottawa built heritage advisory committee is also likely to survive under the Ontario Heritage Act. Donnelly says the city spends $428,000 annually to support all 15 advisory committees. ",

When Bronson Avenue resident Brad Smallwood found out that his street was going to be repaired, he was concerned his wheelchair wouldn\u2019t be able to navigate a road that would be a construction zone for the next two years. \r\rSmallwood has lived in the apartment building at 520 Bronson Ave. since 2007. The building is home to about 14 people with physical disabilities, most of whom are worried about getting around, especially when construction is fully underway. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s practically beginning at my front door,\u201d said Smallwood, an articling student at the Canadian Human Rights Commission. \u201cIt\u2019ll affect my day quite a bit, on a day-to-day basis, just being able to get access to services that I normally do to live my life.\u201dThe Bronson Avenue reconstruction project began March 27 in an effort to revamp the roads and sidewalks and replace the underground pipe system. While many residents will find the road closures inconvenient, Smallwood said he\u2019s worried he won\u2019t even be able to leave his front steps.For example, Smallwood said he typically does his grocery shopping at Hartman\u2019s Independent Grocer at the corner of Bank and Somerset, but he faced a whole host of problems in getting there when the city worked on Bank Street last year. \u201cBecause they tore up all the sidewalks, you\u2019d have to go over makeshift ramps made of wood, or steep inclines,\u201d he said. \u201cI had tremendous difficulty . . .I always had to remember to bring somebody with me that would be there to help if I had to get over things.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m concerned that it\u2019s going to be a similar experience for Bronson.\u201dMeg McCallum, spokesperson for the Centretown Citizens Ottawa Corp., agreed that accessibility is an issue. The CCOC, a private, non-profit housing provider, owns about 50 properties in Ottawa, including 520 Bronson Ave. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be noisy and dusty for everyone, it\u2019s going to be inconvenient for everyone, but if you\u2019re in a wheelchair or have a walker or have to push a stroller, those things that are inconvenient for able-bodied people become insurmountable,\u201d she said, adding she is disappointed the city didn\u2019t consult area residents earlier. In an email, city officials said local traffic, including Para Transpo, would still have access to Bronson. Construction workers will also lay down temporary hard surfaces like sidewalks and makeshift ramps for pedestrians.The city has also guaranteed access to garbage removal, McCallum said. Smallwood said so far, he\u2019s been satisfied with how the city has handled his case. A meeting on March 28 with city officials and representatives from both the construction company and the CCOC convinced him that his concerns were being heard. During the meeting, city officials told the residents of 520 Bronson Ave. that they will always be able to enter their building from Flora Street. As well, if some parts of the street become dangerous during construction, they can contact a city engineer or construction foreman right away and ask them to fix the problem area. Smallwood said while only time will tell whether the city will actually follow through on its promises, he\u2019s glad the city is listening. \u201cThere are obviously going to be situations and scenarios when either the ball gets dropped, or it\u2019s not going to work out the way that they planned,\u201d he said. \u201c(But) if problems can be dealt with in a quick fashion, then that\u2019s all you can ask for.\u201d",

Lund, along with Tungasuvvingat Inuit\u2019s executive director, Jason LeBlanc, decided to refuse the money. Aside from the short duration of the program, the newly changed requirements would have limited the centre\u2019s ability to deliver quality programming, says LeBlanc. The youth program had been wholly dependent on Canadian Heritage funding for more than a decade. LeBlanc says they used to receive about $60,000 in financing each year to run the teen-focused activities in Ottawa. \u00a0The department revamped the Cultural Connections for Aboriginal Youth funding program last year, introducing the new requirements that stood at the centre of the revisions and delays. The budget for youth funding at the department wasn\u2019t cut last year, says LeBlanc. The money is there \u2013 but accessing it had suddenly become a thornier affair.\u00a0For example, Canadian Heritage introduced tighter limits on how much money a youth program could spend on food.Cooking, eating, and learning about traditional Inuit dishes was part of the program\u2019s healthy-living focus. Before the youth program at Tungasuvvingat Inuit disintegrated, it offered a range of activities for local Inuit between the ages of 10 and 25 to get in touch with their Northern culture and community. Sports, craft-making, and storytelling sessions with elders were all part of the mix. Lund estimates that half of Inuit youth in urban Ottawa were involved at the centre, with workshops bringing in as many as 60 youth at a time.\u201cThe youth who have participated have become leaders within the community. Without it, that won\u2019t be happening,\u201d says Lund.And without more stable funding, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll come back, she says. It will take more than two months to establish new relationships with the youth who lost their after-school hangout. The program was the only one of its kind in Ottawa.Other programs targeted at the broader aboriginal community don\u2019t cut it, says Karen Baker-Anderson, executive director of the Ottawa Inuit Children\u2019s Centre. \u201cWhen they go to pan-aboriginal services they don\u2019t see themselves. We think that\u2019s really important because in Ottawa you can\u2019t look out the window and experience your culture. You have to go create it,\u201d she says. The Ottawa Inuit Children\u2019s Centre, which caters to Inuit children up to age 13, is studying the possibility of creating their own youth program for teenagers to fill the gap. ",

For those doing the math, that averages out to around 75 complaints a day. \r\rThese are all dangerous behaviours for which the average citizen gets ticketed. What other service industry would we allow such dangerous and illegal behaviours? Restaurants have to meet cleanliness standards, contractors have to follow building codes. Besides the dangerous driving habits of some of its drivers, the complaints received by OC Transpo included failures in a number of other customer service standards. More than 1,000 of the complaints involved busing schedules. The unpredictability of the bus schedule has become both a source of anger and a running joke in Ottawa. Forget going to Lac Leamy to gamble, passengers can gather at Hurdman and place bets on how late the bus will be, or whether it will show up at all. A free GPS mobile app was OC Transpo\u2019s half-hearted attempt at pacifying riders, but even that endeavor was glitch-ridden and unreliable and has now been scrapped for an overhaul. Here\u2019s a suggestion: instead of passengers tracking the bus on their phones to see whether they will get to work on time, how about just making the buses run on schedule? It is also important to note that not everyone has an iPhone. Those that don't have these devices for one reason or another or can't afford one, also deserve to have a bus schedule that is reliable without needing to purchase an expensive smart phone. What kind of message is the city sending to visitors and tourists who are using OC Transpo? It is already difficult trying to navigate a new city, without the added stress of unreliable and unsafe transit. The 150 complaints in January about \u201cdiscourteous\u201d and \u201crude\u201d drivers would certainly leave a sour taste in the mouths of most visitors to the city.And it isn\u2019t just visitors we should be thinking about, of course; how are we to convince people to take an environmentally friendly commute when our public transit has such as ghastly reputation? The city fired Alain Mercier, the general manager of transit, in February, but there is no sign of improvement on the horizon. John Manconi, OC Transpo\u2019s new boss, is drafting an improvement strategy, but the focus seems to be on bells and whistles instead of the basics. At the top of the agenda is the addition of double-decker buses to the fleet, \u201csmart cards\u201d instead of paper passes, garage renovations and improvements to the GPS apps. Forget modernizing and aesthetics; these are not solutions to unsafe driving, poor etiquette, and not enough buses to meet demand.OC Transpo is lacking in the basics of good business, it is drowning in complaints but is clinging to superficial remedies instead of attacking the roots of the problem. Technology is not the answer; OC Transpo needs to put the \u201cservice\u201d back into \u201ccustomer service\u201d first.",

The Quebec drug manufacturer Sandoz Canada is at the centre of a crisis involving dwindling drug supplies. The emergency has led to surgery cancellations and talk about how exactly the situation became so dire. Sandoz slowed production in February because of a demand by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to improve its quality-control measures. A fire at the plant in early March then halted production briefly, setting supplies back even further.The case is a telling example of how failing to oversee corporations has an immense human cost. Drug manufacturers are not in the business of protecting people\u2019s well-being \u2013 governments are.The shortage has especially affected care of the elderly who suffer from chronic illnesses, which often require the pain medication that is in short supply.Bruy\u00e8re Continuing Care, which also has a unit to care for the dying, has been switching patients from low-supply drugs to medications to conserve its remaining supply. It has also reduced the quantity of medication patients receive.The vice-president of medical affairs, Frank Knoefel, says each patient at Bruy\u00e8re takes on average 10 to 15 medications. Switching can have side effects, and changing medications from the affected injectable drugs to pills is complicated.\u201cThey\u2019re very complex, very frail people so often they can\u2019t swallow. Especially in the last few days of life \u2013 you can imagine in palliative care for instance \u2013 your body is slowly shutting down, so swallowing is really not an option.\u201dEven with the reductions, supplies are teetering on the brink of too low.\u201cIf they stopped delivering altogether, in two to three weeks we\u2019d have a serious problem on our hands,\u201d Knoefel says.He called this a case study of capitalism gone wrong.\u201cYou have a sole-source, which goes bad, and then you have a bureaucracy that cannot react quickly to this drug shortage.\u201dHealth Canada is reviewing applications for alternative suppliers but the process is fraught with red tape. Most of the applications under review come from foreign manufacturing plants that belong to Sandoz. Bureaucracy takes time and that\u2019s one thing patients like those in Bruy\u00e8re\u2019s palliative care unit don\u2019t have. Most patients only have weeks left to live.It shouldn\u2019t take a crisis before we wake up and realize that pure, unregulated capitalism is not an appropriate system when public health is at stake.The Canadian Cancer Society has called the shortage completely unacceptable.\u201cFacts have been difficult to find, and patients, medical professionals and pharmacists have not been given clear information. Full disclosure from the beginning was very much missing,\u201d Lauren Dobson-Hughes, the associate director of public issues, wrote in an email.The society is calling for the federal government to create an early warning system for potential drug shortages.A severe shortage of the anti-convulsion drug phenobarbital has already forced a hospice in Oakville, Ont., to turn away a dying patient who needed the medication. The Hospice at May Court, which cares for a maximum of nine patients at a time, hasn\u2019t felt much of an impact from the shortage yet. But even there, executive director David Hogberg, says the hospice probably doesn\u2019t have enough supply of phenobarbital to accept a patient who needs that drug. Hogberg says such a patient would have to be referred somewhere else.Institutions are at risk of playing a dangerous game of pass-the-patient. The strain on those people and the system is a deplorable example of poor management. While it may be\u00a0 tempting to blame Sandoz for the shortage, it\u2019s government regulation that is lacking in this industry.Barring a major organizational improvement, the shortage will get worse before it improves. The federal government needs to step in and regulate this industry to prevent monopolies over the production of certain drugs.\u201cThe impact is just too great,\u201d Hogberg says. \u201cThere have to be some government controls if there is going to be just one company that makes the drugs. And it\u2019s irresponsible.\u201dIf anyone had looked closely at where most of the country\u2019s drugs were coming from and considered the potential worst-case scenario in the event of a production slowdown, we wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201cWas it forseeable? Of course it was,\u201d says Hogberg.\u202fHogberg is optimistic policy makers will find a solution soon. But the federal government did not give anyone evidence to place confidence in its leadership as it babbled away precious time blaming provincial leaders for their critical lack of foresight.Knoefel says this is also a lesson for health-care providers. He says they should look beyond their own backyards and organize together as a community with a shared interest in doing what\u2019s best for their patients.If a doctor caring for patients at home runs out of medication, that patient must transfer to the hospital for more. A lack of resources unevenly distributed between institutions means when one place runs out, it transfers the somewhere else, constantly chasing after the drugs. This increases the burden on the system.\u201cThat\u2019s not the way to care for people that are ill,\u201d Knoefel says.And that\u2019s what\u2019s most disappointing \u2013 these patients deserve better.",

Now, all it takes is a few keystrokes or the click of a button.\r\rIllustrating this new frontier of activism and charitable giving is Kony 2012.The wildly popular film has been viewed more than 100 million times since it was posted on March 5.The film\u2019s purpose is to promote the charity Invisible Children\u2019s \u201cStop Kony\u201d campaign, which calls for the arrest of the Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony by December 2012. The filmmakers raised $5 million in donations for the charity from viewers in just 48 hours.The film\u2019s content aside, it raises a broader question about how we give to charities in the Internet age. \u00a0\u201cSlacktivism\u201d is defined as feel-good actions that require little effort or sacrifice on the part of the individual. These types of actions work to spread the message of an organization but have little lasting impact.Online activism, or clicktivism, is one branch of this laissez-faire ideology. Individuals sign a petition with their email address, join a Facebook group or share a video via social media, then promptly forget about their involvement.These types of activism assuage guilt and make people feel they don\u2019t need to do more. Petitions prompt people to actively consider an idea, but don\u2019t do much more than that.A more deeply ingrained type of slacktivism is \u201ccause marketing\u201d, a strategy of profit masquerading as social-consciousness. It refers to a type of marketing that sees for-profit companies teaming up with non-profit organizations for mutual benefit. The Pink Ribbon campaign is the most prevalent example.The campaign started in the United States by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation. Consumers buy Pink Ribbon branded items, under the impression that a portion of the proceeds going to the foundation. Everything from toilet paper and M&Ms to cosmetics and handguns are branded. According to the Komen group, the organization raises over $35 million a year from over 60 partnerships.However, a recent National Film Board of Canada documentary called Pink Ribbon Inc. reveals how companies use the branding to improve their public image but only give a small fraction of the profit is given to cancer research and disease prevention.Recently, students at the University of Ottawa and Carleton University took part in the national Five Days for the Homeless campaign. The campaign is a fundraiser for the Centretown charity Operation Come Home, which helps homeless youth.For five days university students slept outdoors with only a pillow and a sleeping bag, no pocket money and subsisting only on food donations all the while attending classes and completing coursework. While the initiative has admirable goals, the actions don\u2019t speak to the seriousness of the issue. It is a simulated experience that trivializes the difficulties they seek to represent. Students sleep on a security patrolled campus. Most important, however, the students know they have a soft bed, hot shower and fridge full of food waiting for them once their stint is over.All of this is not to say that this base level of engagement should stop happening. It\u2019s good that people are finding movements they care about. But individuals need to step away from their computers and realize that actions speak louder than clicks. ",

While professional musicians at the Juno Awards took to the stage at Scotiabank Place last weekend, other performers were plonking away on temporary pianos all across the city. \r\rInspired by the \u201cPlay Me, I\u2019m Yours\u201d international phenomenon, donated pianos were placed at 12 different locations in Ottawa from March 28 to April 1. Host locations included the lobby of the Canadian War Museum and the National Arts Centre. The public was then invited to drop in and perform for other passersby. Beverley McKiver was one of the individuals to take to the ivories at the NAC. As the choir director at Knox United Church in Nepean, she practices music daily to maintain her skills. \u201cI usually have something on the go to keep up my playing,\u201d she says. Performing for the public was a good choice, McKiver explained. \u201cI\u2019m a bit shy, so it was a bold challenge for myself to go and do something like this . . . it\u2019s a great opportunity to have this outlet.\u201dMcKiver says she was glad for the chance to play for people. \u201cIt\u2019s something fun to do . . . music is a form of sharing among people, and can be so inspiring.\u201d Anneka Oudyk has witnessed \u201cPlay Me, I\u2019m Yours\u201d performances during her travel through Europe and says the idea of publically accessible instruments is a brilliant idea. \u201cI just sort of happened across this older fellow playing a ragtag upright piano near Piccadilly,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cI thought it was fantastic that there was this opportunity for people to perform in public.\u201dAs a participant in a number of community-based music ensembles, Oudyk noted how critical it is to bring music back to the community at large. She says a \u201cdivide has developed between (the people) performing and participating in music,\u201d which has led to a decline in accessibility.\u00a0\u201cIt's important for people to just experience music, it's one of the great connectors, and it's tons of fun,\u201d Oudyk says. \u201cIt would be cool to be singing something under your breath and then all of the sudden, boom!

    "body": "A chapter will be ending for Ottawa\u2019s book-loving community because the Nicholas Hoare bookstore is going out of business. \r\rNicholas Hoare has been on Sussex Drive since 1994. This year the store\u2019s landlord, the National Capital Commission, announced rent would be increasing by 72 per cent. This was simply more than the bookstore could afford, according to the owner. Much of Ottawa\u2019s arts community is enraged by the decision to increase rent so significantly. Some are arguing that the NCC should subsidize businesses that contribute to the city\u2019s cultural well-being. This is because the NCC\u2019s mandate is to be the steward for Ottawa\u2019s character. Who wants to see Sussex lined with McDonald\u2019s or other chain stores just because those are the companies that can afford high rent?Yes, maintaining an artistic and culturally vibrant city is important. However, this does not mean that the NCC should reduce rent prices for certain businesses. The onus should be on the businesses to be entrepreneurial and competitive.Although there is nothing comparable to the smell of books and the crisp feeling of opening the spine of a new novel, purely print-based bookstores are becoming anachronisms. Print is dying because people are reading from tablets and even when they order print books, they do it online. Those in the literary industry must brainstorm and implement strategies to survive. Some bookstores have begun selling e-books in addition to physical books. Others have branched out from selling only books and are setting up coffee shops on location too. Stores can also increase the number of events they host such as author visits and book clubs. According to the events calendar on Nicholas Hoare\u2019s website, there are very few events at its Ottawa location. The bookstore could even organize a fundraiser to raise money for the rent increase. It is all about being creative. Furthermore, Nicholas Hoare may have been able to afford the higher rent had it been more innovative in its marketing efforts. On the bookstore\u2019s website it says: \u201cWith a Name Like That, Who Needs Advertising?\u201d Nicholas Hoare was clearly wrong about the impact of its name.In this day and age, name recognition for a small bookstore isn\u2019t enough to attract the business needed to survive. It was presumptuous for the bookstore to believe its name would be sufficient to attract enough consumers to make it thrive. In a broader context, it is important that the NCC does not set the precedent that it will subsidize cultural businesses. First, how would the NCC choose which businesses are worthy of protection? Second, as much as government protection of the arts is necessary to some extent, it is not the NCC\u2019s job to sponsor bookstores. The government already funds the arts through grants to both organizations and individual artists. There is no reason it should be subsidizing arts-related businesses too. In a time of economic prosperity, maybe it would be appropriate to broaden government arts funding. However, with budget cuts across the board, the arts should not be given priority when it comes to government spending. Furthermore, the NCC can still fulfill its mandate and safeguard the cultural vibe of Sussex by ensuring that the new tenant of the venue fits in with the historic and upscale atmosphere of the area. Without Nicholas Hoare, Sussex will survive and continue to be a tourist destination. There are numerous other businesses that can rent the space without ruining the district. There are also many bookstores in the surrounding area for Nicholas Hoare\u2019s old customers to frequent. The bottom line is that, although the closure of Nicholas Hoare is a loss for Ottawa, this is an opportunity for a new beginning on Sussex. It will be interesting to see what replaces the bookstore. Hopefully, cultural businesses will learn a lesson from this and focus business plans on remaining relevant and surviving in this age of technology and rapidly evolving arts consumption. ",

She claimed the championship chicken when the Ottawa Theatre Challenge hit town for the 13th year in a row.\r\r\u201cI\u2019ll either succeed or fail miserably, but that\u2019s theatre, you take risks,\u201d victor Melanie Karin said in the days leading up to the show.Her risk \u2013 going in as a solo performer new to the Ottawa theatre scene \u2013 paid off. She earned bragging rights as Ottawa\u2019s Best Theatre Company on behalf of 411dramaturgy with a skit created only 48 hours in advance and brought home the coveted Rubber Chicken Award.The poultry prize was chosen in a moment of serendipity, says A Company of Fools\u2019 Gertrude Wilkes, but has become a monument to the challenge\u2019s history. The award is a compilation of chickens mounted on a red wooden base: One with an Elvis-style hairdo stands on the left. A highly affronted one gawps from the right. A third lies prone across the base. Deviating from the traditional rubber chicken, a stuffed Angry Bird crowns the top of this year\u2019s trophy. It showcases the spirit of the night, which encourages performers not to take themselves too seriously. The challenge is not so much a competition but a celebration of theatre, says Wilkes. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to challenge yourself and really create something brilliant under a deadline,\u201d says Al Connors, a member of theatre companies Crush Improv and A Company of Fools. With the Fools, Connors took home the Best Dying For Your Art Award.The challenge is also a chance for groups across Ottawa to see what one another can do, said Mike Kosowan, of GRIMprov. The skits were performed at the National Arts Centre on March 27. The mad dash for ideas didn\u2019t start long before then. It began on Inspiration Night, 48 hours before the skits were performed, when groups received one item - a headline, a sound or something edible - from a hat. With a background in improv and a fondness for writing quickly, Karin says the limited time didn\u2019t scare her. Her only worry, she joked, was making sure she didn\u2019t go too crazy during the process. And while an improv background may have helped her, Connors says this isn\u2019t always the case. \u201cThe trouble with improvisers is improvisers like to go off script all the time,\u201d he says, \u201cand if you have a great script you want to stick with it.\u201dKosowan also believes having a background in improv helps. Far from being a risk, going off script was encouraged. Indeed, for GRIMprov, there was no script.They didn\u2019t plan hours in advance for the Challenge; they planned minutes \u2013 even seconds \u2013 in advance and still snagged the Best Product Extension Award for their use of Girl Guide Lettuce. While skit quality and audience reaction are the main criteria for judging, Wilkes says the judges will also take something else into consideration. In the spirit of tomfoolery, participants are encouraged to resort to bribery. Youth theatre Suzart Productions won the award for Most Generous Bribe, according to a press release by the Fools.Their ages were taken into account, however, and the award was soon renamed the \u201cGetting Adults to Buy Us Booze\u201d Award.

I want to change that.\u201dThe show runs April 21 and 22 at Fall Down Gallery on Bank Street.While Sowka admits that Carleton taught her how to add artistic edge to designing everyday products, she says the school does not offer as much of a chance to showcase work outside of class.Now, she\u2019s taking matters into her own hands. \u201cLast year, we ran a lighting exhibition, but it was just presented to our professors.

Ruby Hadley, an Ottawa-native working at a design firm in Hong Kong, says she has noticed other cities do a better job of promoting local talent.\u201cIn places like Hong Kong and even Toronto it seems like every week there is some kind of place for designers to show off their stuff and meet new people from other companies,\u201d she says.Hadley says if Ottawa wants to improve its design culture it\u2019s going to need regular venues for local artists.Ottawa designers seem excited about their newest opportunity.

Olders says she hopes events like these help her meet other artists and inform her of what others are doing within the design scene. Artists can also sell their products to other manufacturers or people who attend the event. But Sowka says that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in making money at all.

She says that after her piece won, she had one month to rewrite it and work with an editor.Saikaley says she is not a lesbian, but that she could imagine the problems homosexual immigrants may encounter.The reality of homosexual immigrants from the Middle East is that they remain closeted once coming to Canada.\u201cIn my own background, I find it isn\u2019t accepted or spoken about,\u201d says Saikaley. \u201cThe most important thing is marriage and having children.\u201dSaikaley says she has spoken with friends from the Ottawa LGBTQ community who are curious about the book, even though many have only disclosed their sexual orientation to immediate family.\u201cNo doubt The Lebanese Dishwasher will stir controversy,\u201d says Harding-Russell. \u201cI consider the subject of homosexuality as it is portrayed in this Montreal Middle Eastern community to represent merely an intensification of the less overt taboos in the rest of North American society.\u201dIacobelli says he expects some\u00a0 to be bothered by the content.\u201cI\u2019m sure some people will be shocked and morally outraged,\u201d says Iacobelli. \u201cIt\u2019s stories like this that expose hidden realities.

Although few details of the event have been released, hundreds are expected to gather on the Hill to show solidarity for the greater Occupy movementAll winter, a group of about 50 volunteers have organized various events and protests shedding light on perceived injustices. They continue to unite to oppose the omnibus crime bill, the robocalls scandal and various labour inequity disputes.In February, members of the movement joined forces with Families of Sisters in Spirit, an organization advocating for families of missing and murdered Aboriginal women, to raise awareness for their cause.\u201cMembers\u00a0 of Occupy were tremendous allies to our organization campaigning for our cause,\u201d says Families of Sisters in Spirit member Kristen Gilchrist. \u201cThey were members on our organizing committee, wrote a song, made an art tableau and were committed advocates.\u201dOccupy activist Mandy Joy says the movement has found a greater purpose since the group began camping in Confederation Park last year.\u201cOccupy has formed into an outlet for public discourse that wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d says Joy. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of activism under the radar, but it is capturing people\u2019s imaginations.\u201dAt the beginning of June, Occupy Ottawa will host activists from across the country for a conference called Take Back Democracy. Organizations from coast-to-coast will be communicating to share new protest tactics, build their political awareness skills and circulate the message of the Occupy movement. \u00a0\u201cPeople never thought of how to change the world before and we finally found a way to do it now,\u201d says Joy. \u201cOur ideas weren\u2019t on the political agenda before and now they are.\u201dJoy says volunteers have been talking about reoccupation of city land since the National Capital Commission evicted protesters from Confederation Park last November. In a notice to Occupy protesters last November, the National Capital Commission said \u201cno person is permitted to camp or erect a tent in Confederation Park. All persons who are camping or have erected a tent must cease these activities.\u201dNow, the group is confident that if a camp is established, it will run more efficiently. Last time, numerous safety and security concerns received widespread media attention overshadowing the cause. \u00a0 \u201cWe ran into a couple problems last time around but now we know to set up the infrastructure differently, and which initiatives need more planning,\u201d says Joy.Goldring says that the group\u2019s initiatives over the winter are examples of the progress it has made since the movement began last fall. He says that although the lessons learned from last time might not save the group from an inevitable eviction, camping is not the point of the demonstration.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see the social change coming from camping in a park, but it will help foster a dialogue,\u201d he says. The group feels that it has been successful in spreading the word and clarifying its purpose, and believes they are now a leading a movement for change and equality.\u201cIt may not seem like it from the outside, but on the inside it does,\u201d Joy says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much energy here, plans and ideas to grow ourselves and lots of support from unions, organizations and businesses.\u201d ",

The Kitchissippi councillor is determined to investigate ways to make Ottawa\u2019s residential roads safer. \r\rIn early March, Hobbs wanted the city to investigate the possibility of enforcing a 40-km/h speed limit on all residential roads. Mixed responses from her fellow councillors and a $5-million price tag have cut that idea short. However, Hobbs will continue in her efforts to calm traffic in Ottawa. The councillor\u2019s new plan is to create a toolkit for communities that would give them options to develop safer and slower streets at a lesser expense. These choices would include using more effective street signs and painting pedestrian pathways on the roads. Hobbs also wants communities to look at artistic street-painting projects that would make motorists aware when they\u2019re driving in residential areas. \u201cWe need to do something, and we really need to look at a lot of different out-of-the-box ideas in order to keep our city very livable as we grow,\u201d says Hobbs.

He believes Ottawa\u2019s community associations, school councils, cyclists and pedestrians will support a movement toward speed reductions in residential areas throughout the city. The Ontario Highway Traffic Act currently sets the residential road speed at 50 km/h. University of Ottawa transportation expert Barry Wellar agrees. While doing safety studies for the City of Ottawa in the 1990s, Wellar says he observed that fast motorists in residential intersections were a serious concern. \u201cThe City of Ottawa needs to be ahead of the curve, not behind it,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it makes a huge amount of sense and I suggest it\u2019s overdue.\u201dHobbs expects to propose the idea of community toolkits to city council by the end of the year.",

I heard some people who said \u2018if Paul Dewar doesn\u2019t make it, (Mulcair) is our vote back home.\u2019 \"Despite the 49-year-old\u2019s imaginative use of hip-hop and fiery rhetoric against Prime Minister Harper the day before, his faltering use of French was widely cited\u00a0 as the main reason for his poor convention showing.The NDP\u2019s gains in Quebec, clinching 58 of 75 House of Commons seats last May, meant competency in French was essential to lead the Official Opposition.One Quebec NDP MP, Gatineau\u2019s Fran\u00e7oise Boivin, cited Dewar\u2019s lack of French fluency as the \u201conly glitch in his campaign.\u201d\u201cA lot of people realize, because of our success in Quebec, you definitely need to be bilingual.\u201dThe fear of losing Quebec forced members in the 11th hour before the first ballot was closed to vote against him, according to Boivin.\u201cOther than the language glitch, my hats off to him. He was and is a great guy,\u201d said the Brian Topp supporter.Interim NDP Leader Nycole Turmel declined to comment on Dewar specifically, but she said that the system of voting left three \u201cfully bilingual\u201d candidates on the table \u2013 Nathan Cullen, Brian Topp, and Thomas Mulcair.Mulcair eventually won after four excruciating ballots; Topp placed second and Cullen third.\u201cWe had seven great candidates (on first ballot) and I can work with any of them. It\u2019s up to the membership to choose which of them is the best to represent the party.\u201d said Turmel.Dewar said he never hid the fact that his French was still a work in progress.He said he thought that other caucus and party supporters would be able to see beyond his still-improving French language skills.\u201cI had my Quebec colleagues come on board who thought \u2018it\u2019s good enough and he\u2019ll be able to carry our party and not only keep Quebec but grow outside.\u2019 \u201dAfter announcing his bid for the leadership, Dewar enlisted the aid of a French- language tutor. The tutor travelled with him across the country in the\u00a0 campaign.\u201cI made great progress throughout and earned a lot of respect from people,\u201d Dewar said. In the end, his hard work failed to convince enough of the 131,000 party members across the country to select him as leader.Dewar, who was the NDP\u2019s high-profile foreign affairs critic before announcing his leadership bid last October, has indicated that he will serve in whatever capacity Mulcair assigns to him. He is widely expected to retain the foreign affairs shadow portfolio.",

It really reduces a student\u2019s reliance on teachers and prepares them for high school and university,\u201d she says.In the school board\u2019s latest embrace of computer-assisted technology, students can even access teaching tools by logging on to school software from a home computer. Premier AT Home, for instance, allows students to convert documents into audio files that can be played on MP3 players and iPods to help students prepare for tests.As a result, technology once used only for special needs students is now taking the teaching process beyond the classroom and aiding any student who wants extra help after school hours, says Ian McVicar, the director of Premier Assistive Canada, a Nova Scotia-based company which designs interactive teaching tools.\u201cStudents are only in school 162 days of the year, so a kid that needs literary help can now access it whenever they need it,\u201d says McVicar.\u201cIf it's summertime and a young boy wants to go on the TSN website and read the starting line up for his favourite baseball team, even if he is a beginner reader he will be able to teach himself difficult words.\u201dBecause many learning disabilities aren't diagnosed until Grade 4, introducing the technology early helps to ensure that special needs students don\u2019t get left out of the learning process, says McVicar.The introduction of assistive technology is partially a response to a report by the Ontario Ministry of Education in 2003 called The Report of the Expert Panel on Early Reading in Ontario.The report notes that special needs students who experience difficulty reading in Grade 3 \u201cseldom catch up in later grades.\u201dBy making this technology available to all students as they begin to read, students with undiagnosed learning disabilities will benefit, says McVicar.",

The agency\u2019s research shows that after living in Canada for 10 years or longer, immigrants report being less healthy than Canadian-born residents and their mortality rates tend to rise the longer they\u2019re here.Christina Marchant, director of community health promotion and early years at Centretown Community Health Centre, says she\u2019s noticed more newcomers coming into her centre\u2019s immigrant clinic.\u201cA lot of it has to do with being in a new country and adapting to new systems,\u201d she says. \u201cWe feel it\u2019s time to draw Centretown-wide attention to it.\u201dMarchant says there are many reasons why immigrants encounter health problems when they immigrate to Canada, including the stress of settlement, language barriers, income issues, and lack of social support, healthy food and physical activity.According to the Ottawa Neighbourhood Study, about 34 per cent of Centretown residents immigrated to Canada between 1997 and 2006. This is seven per cent higher than the city-wide average.Community health centres play an important role in making sure immigrants in Centretown understand how they can avoid health risks, says Jack McCarthy, executive director of the Somerset West Community Health Centre.\u201cOur challenge is to adapt our message so that we\u2019re getting it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cLike offering services in the language people understand so it fits their needs.\u201dBut McCarthy says instead of supporting health-centre programs, governments tend to fund hospitals and drugs. This disregards vulnerable newcomers who have a hard time understanding and navigating their way through the system, he adds.McCarthy suggests governments \u201cstrategically invest\u201d in the community and settlement sectors.\u201cWe have to realign our system to focus on strengthening communities, their agencies and health centres to meet the needs of newcomer populations,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start that realignment, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a lot of change and people are going to continue to struggle.\u201dThe government seems to be sticking to the status quo, says Rupert Yeung, manager of client services at Ottawa Chinese Community Services Centre in Centretown. Last year, his agency lost 30 per cent of its funding after Citizenship and Immigration Canada made deep cuts, forcing his centre to let go of some settlement workers who assisted Chinese immigrants, he says.Lucya Spencer, executive director of Immigrant Women Services Ottawa, says without the support of community groups, new Canadians are often lost and uninformed about available resources. Lack of funding limits the ability of agencies to reach out to newcomers, she says.Spencer says there is a need for collaboration between all parties involved with the immigrant population.\u201cPartnership can go a long way in reaching more people in our communities,\u201d she says. \u201cBy teaming up, we will have a bigger impact.\u201dMcCartney and Marchant agree that in order to provide the best possible support to new Canadians, connecting and collaborating with service groups \u2013 which are in regular contact with immigrants \u2013 is essential.Yeung says as a result of funding cuts, his centre has already turned to community health centres for support.\u201cIt has reached a very critical point,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are very concerned and not sure how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201dMarchant says she hopes with more programming and attention to \u201cpolicy advocacy,\u201d newcomer health will improve.\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to do is reverse the newcomer health effect,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople who come to Canada will be healthy, stay healthy, and raise healthy children.",

Two Centretown start-up tech companies are among a handful of Ottawa businesses chosen to receive funding and business skills training through VentureStart, a new program for entrepreneurs in Southern Ontario.\r\rInsight Design Labs and Gnowit Inc. will get up to $30,000 in grants as well as mentorship support through the program, which is designed to boost the success rate of new technology ventures.\u201cThe funding is going to really help us improve our go-to market strategy and pay for a lot of expenses,\u201d says Mohammad Al Azzouni, a co-founder of Gnowit, a software development company that tracks online digital and social media.Being strapped for resources was preventing Gnowit from hiring developers to help the company finish its latest media-monitoring software and put it on the market, says Al Azzouni.\u201cNow, there\u2019s one less thing we have to worry about and we can focus on creating better value for customers,\u201d he says.The VentureStart program, launched in March by the Research Innovation Commercialization Centre in Mississauga, expects to train 450 entrepreneurs over 15 months and provide as much as $4 million in financing to selected candidates.\u201cAs a small business, you\u2019re always looking for cash. The kind of technology we\u2019re building requires very specialized talent that isn\u2019t readily available and is generally expensive,\u201d says Allan Silburt, president of Insight Design Labs, a firm that builds chip hardware used in stock exchange trading. \u201cWith the knowledge of this funding coming in, we were able to commit to hiring people to come on board and help us.\u201dTo be eligible for VentureStart, business owners have to complete an accredited entrepreneurial training program and a critical factor assessment by the Mississauga centre to pinpoint flaws that could interfere with the start-ups\u2019 success.Local economic development agency Invest Ottawa and Carleton University\u2019s Lead to Win entrepreneurial training program are partnering to help the city\u2019s startups pass both stages of the program.Both Gnowit and Insight Design Labs completed the first phase of the program through the Lead to Win program.The training is free for start-ups planning to bring at least six jobs to the Ottawa region within the next three years.VentureStart requires start-ups to match any seed funding that gets awarded. If a company only has $10,000, for example, the maximum seed funding it can get is $10,000.\u201cYou\u2019re putting skin in the game and that means you\u2019re serious. That\u2019s why they\u2019re asking them to match it, otherwise it\u2019s welfare for companies,\u201d says Tony Bailetti, a Carleton University professor who runs the Lead to Win program.Bailetti says $60,000 \u2013 the sum the start-ups will have if they chip in $30,000 and receive $30,000 in grant money \u2013 is just the right amount needed to start a business. But it\u2019s the educational support, not just the financial support, that makes the VentureStart program unique, says Bruce Lazenby, the CEO of Invest Ottawa.\u201cIf you want to be world class, you\u2019d better find a coach,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them access to our serial, successful entrepreneurs in residence who can give them advice and guidance.\u201dVentureStart is funded through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, the Canadian Innovation Centre and a group of non-profit organizations.

And last week, lightning struck again.\r\rThe latest spat occurred when Elgin Street business owners raised a stink about the City of Ottawa\u2019s decision to move the Rideau Station, which was set to have an entrance facing Elgin Street at the National Arts Centre.Some have argued that they will lose business because potential customers will be diverted to the new stop, which is now designed to connect to the Rideau Centre, closer to the Byward Market.The owner of the Lord Elgin Hotel even offered to pony up $2 million over 10 years to keep the Elgin Street station right on his inn\u2019s doorstep.Too little, too late, said the city.Business access and economic growth is a driving force to the light rail plan. According to the project\u2019s website, \u201cLRT stations linked to area businesses promote intensification and clusters of higher-density employments uses, encouraging new investment.\u201dIn this sense, it would have made sense to connect the station to the Rideau Centre and closer to the Byward Market in the first place. The reason the city kept the original entrance closer to Confederation Park was to have a stop that would encompass some of the national capital\u2019s gems like Parliament Hill and the National War Memorial.It\u2019s easy to understand where Elgin\u2019s business owners are coming from. They were excited about getting a light-rail station right in their backyard, and then the rug was pulled out from under them.But the change is nothing to get up in arms about.The economic benefits of a light rail station filtering customers into the area are indisputable. The diversion of commuters towards the busy restaurants and bars on Elgin Street is a business owner\u2019s dream.What\u2019s also undeniable is that Elgin Street is a business hotspot. But the area\u2019s economic output can\u2019t match the combined yield of the Byward Market and the Rideau Centre.Furthermore, the walk from the nearest station at Queen and O\u2019Connor streets to the site of the former Rideau Station is roughly five minutes, which arguably qualifies as a jaunt.As it is, Elgin Street has done just fine with limited transit service, and will continue to thrive when the 12.5-kilometre transit system is finished.For those who want to walk from the Rideau Station to Elgin or the NAC, they will be able to do a large part of the trip in the luxury of a heated Rideau Centre.Once outside, who doesn\u2019t enjoy a chance to walk through Confederation Park?Mayor Jim Watson is considering other LRT options, including an underground walkway. Regardless, from a business standpoint, the station relocation makes sense.The city said its decision to move the station east of Sussex Drive fit with its budgetary standards and the $900 million it has committed to the $2.1-billion project and its 13 stations.According to council\u2019s reviews, the Rideau Station\u2019s new location will be cheaper to build, since the old station was set to run beneath the Rideau Canal.The city has also said that the move was a better transit solution because of balanced ridership and the opportunity to provide entrances closer to transit riders\u2019 origins and destinations.Frankly, the Rideau Centre is as much of a commuter hub as there is in the city.The city can\u2019t please everyone by erecting stations at every intersection.The city is going to be forking over nearly a billion dollars to get the project off the ground and it needs the investment to pay all the economic dividends it can.Elgin Street\u2019s business owners are going to have to live with the city\u2019s decision to move Rideau station, one that makes logical business sense. The project won\u2019t be up and running until 2018.Even though opponents may be fired up about the decision, they have six years to cool off.",

New businesses that rent\u202fspace in National Capital Commission heritage\u202fbuildings\u202fon\u202fSparks Street\u202fare upset with the Crown corporation because they say that the slow-moving bureaucracy makes it difficult to get their businesses up and running. \r\rDavid Flemming, former president of Heritage Ottawa, says he understands that some businesses may find it frustrating to operate under the NCC\u2019s supervision. \u201cOne of the difficulties with the federal government is they tend to do what they want and although they might consult with the local community, they don\u2019t always listen,\u201d he says. Because they are heritage sites, Flemming says the businesses along Sparks Street are expected to uphold high standards for historical preservation.Su-Phoung Chu, owner of the new salon Her Esthetician, says it\u2019s been frustrating to work with the NCC, which needs to approve her construction decisions. Her latest concern is the salon\u2019s missing exterior sign.\u201cIt is not there right now and they said in a couple of weeks but they keep saying it will be in a couple of weeks,\u201d she says.Chus says her sign was first approved by the Sparks Street Business Improvement Area but still needs approval from the NCC which owns the building. It has now been six months since she opened and the sign is still not up. A couple of entrances down from Chu\u2019s salon, new gym Greco Lean and Fit had similar problems with the NCC and signage. \u201cThey made up problems because they want to know every nut and bolt you design,\u201d says the gym\u2019s owner, Phil Scavo. He explains that the NCC requested several architectural drawings from every angle before they allowed him to build it. \u201cMore drawings cost me more money,\u201d he says.\u201cI come from the private sector so for me everything is redundant, everything bothers me,\u201d Scavo says. \u201cI mean, in theory they have a job to do. They keep the heritage.\u201d This is how the NCC sees it, according to Cedric Pelletier, a communications officer with the commission. Before the NCC even agrees to lease out one of their heritage buildings, the prospective business must undergo an approval process, he said in an email.\u201cThe NCC puts a lot into the preservation of the heritage character of these buildings while making them available for contemporary use,\u201d he says. On Sparks Street, the NCC\u2019s properties are mainly located on the south side between O\u2019Connor and Elgin treets.During review, the NCC considers, \u201ctype of business, how does the business fit into the area, business experience of prospective tenant and financial factors.\u201d Flemming maintains that the NCC has been a fairly good custodian of Ottawa\u2019s heritage, particularly along Sparks Street. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t stepped in along Sparks Street I think we probably would have lost a lot of those buildings along the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the city would have looked after them. They would have sold them.\u201dFlemming also points out that there is a certain reassurance for businesses in a federally owned area that if new development was proposed, it would be subject to the same approval process. In other words, he says, no large neon signs or 12 story condominiums are going up on Sparks Street any time soon.The sign outside Her Esthetician is currently covered with black garbage bags. But Chu says she is expecting the approval to come through soon. As long as the NCC doesn\u2019t keep her in the dark about policy changes, Chu says the Sparks Street heritage location will help keep her family-run salon afloat. \u201cIn the summer it is busy and there is still always going to be people because this is where the government and MPs are,\u201d she says.",

So far, the petition has more than 600 signatures, but hopes to garner 2,000.  In a city rich with cultural diversity and skilled culinary chefs, are French fries and hamburgers the best Ottawa can do on the streets? \r\r\u00a0Food enthusiasts think not.\u00a0They have launched an online petition aimed at increasing the number of street vendors and providing more diverse, vibrant and local food options. With more than 600 signatures, the petition is on its way to the goal of 2,000. When that target is reached, it will be brought to the attention of city hall in the hopes of transforming Ottawa\u2019s current street food scene.Currently, permits for new street vendors are almost impossible to obtain. Licenses aren\u2019t transferrable and the city isn\u2019t issuing any new permits. \u201cPeople on the streets have had licenses since 1994 or before and so there is no room for change or improvement in the way it\u2019s laid out right now,\u201d says Jacqueline Jolliffe, chef and owner of Stone Soup Foodworks. \u00a0Her food truck specializes in organic and local soups, salads and tacos at the University of Ottawa campus on Marie Curie Drive. Until recently, Ontario only allowed items that were pre-cooked and prepared beforehand to be sold from mobile food vehicles in the hopes of decreasing food borne illness. This restriction limited menu options as hot dogs and burgers became staples of nearly every vendor\u2019s menu. \u201cOttawa\u2019s current street food situation is next to non-existent. It\u2019s basically limited to chip wagons,\u201d says Chin.In 2007, Ontario changed its regulations and placed street food options under the jurisdiction of the municipal Medical Officers of Health, which allowed decisions about street food to be made on a local level. However, the opportunity to enhance street food was never taken and the situation continues to remain the same. Current regulations \u201cdoesn\u2019t use street food to its full potential,\u201d says Jolliffe. \u00a0Jolliffe says there are not a lot of vendors that offer local and healthy food, and feels that Ottawa isn\u2019t living up to its full street food potential. \u00a0She says she hopes that the petition will start a discussion and bring a variety of street food to Ottawa. \u201cI would like a focus on sustainability; I want something that is fresh, healthy, sustainable and tasty.\u201d Chin says that Ottawa has a responsibility to bring better food to its streets. \u201cBeing the nation\u2019s capital, people have to be creative with their food,\u201d he says. \u00a0\u201cFood trucks not only inspire taste buds but it gives a city a cultural identity. I think someone should capitalize on the idea of food trucks and show that Ottawa is not only the nation\u2019s capital for politics but it can be the nation\u2019s capital for food as well, \u2018cause in the end, everyone\u2019s got to eat.\u201d ",

    "body": "Laura Kluz, Centretown NewsMark Boushey supports a bill that expands his right to defend his property, but is unlikely to take advantage of it. Owners of several Centretown convenience stores say they won\u2019t be tying up shoplifters as Toronto shopkeeper David Chen did, controversially, a few years ago, but they would still welcome a proposed federal law that would make it easier to place thieves under citizen\u2019s arrest.\r\rMeanwhile, lawyers and security industry representatives disagree over whether the bill will actually help bust criminals or just lead to an increase in heavy-handed conduct by security guards.Bill C-26, the Citizen\u2019s Arrest and Self Defense Act, which is headed for third reading in the House of Commons, would allow property owners and those who work for them to place suspected criminals under citizen\u2019s arrest \u201cwithin a reasonable time after the offence is committed.\u201d Currently, proprietors can only arrest suspects if they catch them red-handed.The bill was inspired by Chen, who tied up a shoplifter outside his Lucky Moose Food Mart in Toronto in 2009. In a case that drew loud protests that the justice system was \u201cpersecuting the victim,\u201d Chen was charged with assault and forcible confinement for his actions. Authorities said he had no right to make the arrest because more than an hour had passed since the theft had occurred. Chen was ultimately found not guilty. \u201cI do think victims\u2019 rights have been trampled on and it\u2019s time for the pendulum to swing back to the middle,\u201d says Chris Wilcox, vice-president and general manager of the Ottawa-based Quickie chain. Quickie is a member of the Canadian Convenience Stores Association, which supported Bill C-26 before the House justice committee.But Wilcox says he would never risk the safety of his staff by asking them to confront thieves. Other shop owners agree, saying that the bill is more a symbolic recognition of their right to defend their property than something they\u2019d actually take advantage of.\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d says Mark Boushey, of Boushey\u2019s Fruit Market on Elgin Street. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to risk yourself for a five-dollar piece of cheese.\u201dOthers support the legislation.\u201cWe are in favour legally to have the right, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d adds Ali Karimi, owner of Ottawa\u2019s four-store Zesty chain, which has locations on Rideau, Elgin and Bank streets. One Centretown criminal lawyer says cases such as Chen\u2019s are extremely rare. \u201cWhat we see a lot more in our courts are examples of private security being somewhat heavy-handed in how they interact with members of the public,\u201d says Leo Russomanno, of the Lisgar Street firm Webber Schroeder Goldstein Abergel. He told the justice committee recently that Bill C-26 is problematic because it would give more power to private security guards like the ones that patrol shopping malls \u2013 and he says those private guards lack the training and accountability of police. But Ross McLeod, president of the Association of Professional Security Agencies, counters that it\u2019s easier to hold private security agents accountable than police. Complainants can go to the Ministry of Corrections, which can revoke licences and fine or charge delinquent agents, says McLeod. Victims of out-of-line security guards can also sue the security company. \u201cGetting any kind of action through the complaints process to the police is notoriously unproductive in all that I\u2019ve read about it,\u201d McLeod adds Russomanno says current laws successfully protected Chen from conviction so there\u2019s no need to change them.But McLeod says there are still good reasons to give people more time to make citizen\u2019s arrests: a suspect might escape but turn up later, a more serious incident might temporarily divert security, or an agent might need to call for help if a suspect looks too big for one person to arrest.\u201cBill C-26 is not breaking new ground,\u201d he says, \u201c(it\u2019s) just catching up with reality.\u201d ",

The National Capital Commission has expressed interest in the past in acquiring the Domtar lands, an important part of the capital region\u2019s cultural, industrial and First Nations history. \u00a0\u201cWe absolutely recognize that this site is at the heart of the national capital and we are doing our best to make sure it gets sold in a way that respects the heritage value and the development potential of this site,\u201d says Stuart Lister, Domtar\u2019s manager of corporate communications and public affairs.But, the NCC\u2019s plans of restoring buildings on the island for use by the government are on hold for now, according to a spokesman for the federal agency.Still, Ottawa Centre MPP Yasir Naqvi says the NCC is ultimately key to the future of the area and that the City of Ottawa has little influence over plans to repurpose the island. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much up to the NCC and federal government on how to handle the issue,\u201d he says.NCC spokesman Mario Tremblay says the commission developed conceptual designs for the area in the early 1990s.

But he added: \u201cThe NCC will try to acquire them if the money is available and if the properties become available.\u201d The acquisition and redevelopment of the island could round out the NCC\u2019s vision of waterfront beautification in the heart of the national capital. But the island has been in private hands since the early 1800s and Dalhousie Community Association president Eric Darwin says it\u2019s probably best that way. \u00a0\u201cI really like the idea of someone like the distillery district, a private firm, coming in, because they understand their product has to be usable, it has to be a livable space that works and supports the merchants and businesses,\u201d Darwin says.Darwin says the abandoned industrial facilities should be redeveloped with a focus on residential living spaces.\"Right now, in Ottawa we say these are valuable public lands, we can't have condos there where only rich people live, and the result is that you end up with the Museum of Civilization and the National Gallery and the War Museum that all take up extremely valuable waterfront space,\" says Darwin.

The Library of Parliament has brought Winston Churchill to Centretown. \r\rAn exhibit, entitled \u201cWinston: From Canada to the World,\u201d was presented by the Churchill Archives Centre to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the British wartime prime minister\u2019s speech \u201cSome Chicken, Some Neck,\" which was delivered to a joint session of the Canadian Parliament on Dec. 30, 1941.The exhibit includes original notes from his speech, including some alterations that he made himself. The core of the exhibit is the page that includes the \u201cSome Chicken, Some Neck\u201d insertions. This was a reference to a remark made by French Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, future leader of the Vichy French government. P\u00e9tain, convinced that Germany would invade Britain, told Churchill that within three weeks Britain would \u201chave its neck wrung like a chicken.\u201dChurchill told the Canadian Parliament: \u201cWhen I warned them that Britain would fight on alone whatever they did, their generals told their Prime Minister and his divided Cabinet, \u2018In three weeks England will have her neck wrung like a chicken.\u2019 Some chicken! Some neck!\u201dThe original pages are accompanied by vintage film of Churchill\u2019s speech in both English and French. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting because there were only two of Churchill\u2019s wartime speeches,\u201d says Dianne Brydon, director general of Learning and Access Services at the Library of Parliament.\u00a0 \u201cAnd this is one of them.\u201d The speech was broadcast on newsreels around the world. \u201cIt really put Canada on the map during the Second World War,\u201d says Brydon,\"it was one of his most famous speeches.\u201dAlso on display is a signed copy of the iconic photograph of Churchill taken immediately following his speech by Ottawa photographer Yousuf Karsh. The Churchill Archives Centre at the University of Cambridge has all of Churchill\u2019s papers. The 70th anniversary of Churchill\u2019s memorable speech took place in December 2011. Allen Packwood, director of the Churchill Archives Centre, suggested they loan some of the speech notes to help commemorate the event's anniversary. \u201cThis was a key moment for Churchill and for Canada,\u201d Packwood says. \u201cThe speech articulates the values for which the Allies fought. The ensuing victory has shaped Canada and the modern world.\u201dThe exhibit is part of every Parliamentary tour. \u201cWhen people tour other parliamentary buildings, they get to tour the library. So we expect about 100,000 people to go past the exhibit between now and the end of June,\u201d Brydon says. Carleton University history professor Paul Ritt applauds the exhibit\u2019s intentions. \u201cIt shows Canada really being involved and being a key player,\u201d Ritt says. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole celebrity cult with Churchill, and the Second World War was a significant episode in both Canadian and world history. I think hooking Canada into the bigger picture in this way is a good thing.\u201d",

On April 22, Shawn Dawson will lead a group of Ottawa residents on a climb to Mount Everest\u2019s base camp, at an elevation of 5,181.6 metres.\u00a0 \r\rThe group will be trekking for about six to eight hours per day, and moving up about 914.4 metres each day to raise money for charity.\u201cEverest base camp is the world\u2019s mecca of treks,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most majestic and difficult treks in the world, but it\u2019s still a case where ordinary people can do extraordinary things.\u201d But the real challenge for the team will be dealing with the change in altitude. \u201cAltitude can be extremely difficult and even life threatening,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cIt all depends on the acclimatization process and having people who can recognize the signs of altitude sickness.\u201dAltitude can make an easy walk extremely difficult, making people short of breath and faint, even over short distances. \u201cThe trick with altitude is, as soon as the process begins then you have to go back,\u201d says Dawson.A few years ago, Dawson founded the Dream Mountain Foundation, which uses climbs like this to raise money for seven charities. It\u2019s seven charities because of the seven continents highest peaks, each of which Dawson has climbed for a good cause.Dawson raised $150,000 through those seven climbs and decided then to organize more trips. But this time he wanted to bring people along to help spread the idea. \u201cWhen I did the seven summits I wanted it to be about something bigger than myself and that\u2019s when I formed Dream Mountain,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cIt\u2019s seven charities close to my heart for the seven summits.\u201dThe first group trek was to Mount Kilimanjaro last year, where Dawson\u2019s Dream Mountain Foundation raised over $100,000.Darren Prashad co-ordinated the Everest trip and will be taking part in his first climb. He\u2019s been preparing with the group on regular Sunday hikes through the Gatineau Hills, but says it\u2019s impossible to know how your body will react to the altitude. \u201cYou could be a soldier, tri-athlete or marathon runner and when you get up into those kinds of altitudes it could hit you just like anybody else,\u201d says Prashad.It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever done anything like this, but Prashad says he\u2019s excited about the trip. \u201cBeing in the Himalayas is going to be a great experience, but helping out Care Canada is what\u2019s driving me to make it all the way to base camp.\u201dAlso taking part in the Everest trek is Centretown resident Katie Martin. She\u2019s known Dawson for 20 years and finally decided to join him on one of his adventures. She was inspired by one of Dawson\u2019s favourite charities, Dreams Take Flight, which takes disadvantaged Ottawa children on a one day trip to Disney World.\u201cI talked to him the day after one of their trips and he was just so happy to have helped,\u201d says Martin. \u201cI could just hear the pride in his voice and how honoured he was to have been a part of it.\u201d Martin is looking forward to the trek, but says family and friends have been giving her plenty of advice. \u201cSo many have done something similar and they all tell me the same thing,\u201d says Martin. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing experience, but they would never do it again.\u201dIn spite of this, Martin is planning on a second adventure next spring when Dawson\u2019s Dream Mountain series moves to the Inca Trail in Peru.",

    "body": "The NFL is desperate to change its image in an era where concussions and brain injuries are a major concern. \r\rThat\u2019s the message being sent out in the wake of a bounty scandal that has rocked the New Orleans Saints organization.The league recently discovered that beginning in 2009, players on the Saints defence were given cash incentives for injuring opponents. Some $1,500 went to anyone who knocked an opposing player from the game. If he needed to be carted off the field, the reward was $1,000.For his involvement, Saints head coach Sean Payton was suspended without pay for the upcoming 2012 season. He was set to make $7.5 million this year. Former defensive co-ordinator Gregg Williams, the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the operation, has been suspended indefinitely. In addition, general manager Mickey Loomis has been suspended for eight games. Afterwards, both Payton and Loomis acknowledged that the violations \u201chappened under (their) watch.\u201dThe team has also been fined $500,000. More important for the organization, it will forfeit two second-round draft picks in 2012 and another in 2013.It is one of the most severe penalties ever handed out in league history and it\u2019s left some football fans scratching their heads. After all, this is a game where players are paid huge salaries to inflict pain on their opponents. When a superstar player is having a great game in the NFL, it\u2019s na\u00efve to think opponents aren\u2019t encouraged to take him out. The same can be said of most sports worldwide.Professional athletes are in the business of winning and sending an opponent to the sidelines helps you do that.From a young age, football players are wired to hit everything that moves on the field, and to do it as hard as they can. In college, many programs hand out stickers to be displayed on player\u2019s helmets as a reward for key contributions. While some of those stickers represent players fighting through a difficult injury or scoring an important touchdown, there is no doubt that many are given for laying out a huge hit.Built on this foundation of violence, the NFL has become the most lucrative sports league on the planet.So why the sudden interest in player safety? Football fans are changing and Goodell is making sure his league is doing the same.In February 2011, former NFLer Dave Duerson shot and killed himself in his Florida apartment. The suicide note left only inches from where his body fell was brief: \u201cPlease, see that my brain is given to the NFL\u2019s brain bank.\u201d After testing it was revealed that Duerson \u2013 only 50 years old at the time of his death \u2013 suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by multiple concussions.Last month, his son Tregg filed a wrongful death suit against the NFL, among other parties. He claims the league has misrepresented the impact of brain injuries on its players, including his father.Reports from ESPN indicate that the NFL is facing more than 600 similar lawsuits. Those lawsuits are the backdrop for Goodell\u2019s firm response to the Saints\u2019 bounty program.The commissioner needs to show fans that the NFL cares about its players. That\u2019s what he did with this punishment \u2013 and he should be applauded.In the past, the league would have swept the situation under the rug. That\u2019s exactly what happened 23 years ago with the Philadelphia Eagles, when a similar system was in place under head coach Buddy Ryan.\u201cBounty Bowl\u201d as it was called, saw allegations that Ryan placed a $200 bounty on Dallas Cowboys kicker Luis Zendejas, who was cut by the Eagles earlier in the year.The situation was shrugged aside, and fans accepted it as a simple case of men playing a dangerous game. But times have changed. Popular pre-game segments emphasizing huge hits are a thing of the past. One in particular, ESPN\u2019s \u201cJacked Up\u201d was taken off the air in 2007 amidst concerns that it was promoting violence. People pay to watch players crush each other within the rules of the game. They\u2019re willing to accept that one of the most common sights in football is a player lying on the ground in agony while the opposition celebrates. What they won\u2019t stand for is the notion that their beloved sport is no different than a premeditated assault where players are given specific incentives to hurt others. ",

Players are heading to the provincial tournament in St. Catharines this month. Walking into the basement of St. Anthony\u2019s Italia Soccer Club on a Tuesday night, visitors will find dozens of people enjoying a few drinks, eating and socializing. \r\rBut they are not just there to enjoy each other\u2019s company. They are there to play darts \u2013 in the city\u2019s most competitive league. The Greater Ottawa Super Single Darts League, which plays out of St. Anthony\u2019s off Preston Street in Little Italy, is one of the most competitive darts leagues in Ottawa. More than 50 players are part of the league, which is celebrating its 25th season. President Randy Sheik, who has been playing in the league for the past 22 years, says he has enjoyed watching the organization grow increasingly competitive, with no shortage of players. \u201cThere were 21 players from last year who decided not to sign back up for the league, which had me worried,\u201d says Sheik. \u201cBut we had lots of new people eager to join, and now we have more players than last year.\u201d This month will prove to be a busy one, as the league prepares to send players to provincials and host a nationally ranked tournament. Throughout the season, the players host tournaments where the winners qualify for the provincial tournament, held in St. Catharines this weekend. Mike Aubrey is one of the league\u2019s veterans, throwing darts\u00a0 for the past 11 years. He will be one of several players representing the league at the provincial tournament this year. Aubrey\u2019s goal is a top eight finish, which would qualify him for the Canadian National Adult Championship, held June 12 \u2013 15\u00a0\u00a0 in Thunder Bay. But with almost 300 skilled darts players in the tournament, he knows a top eight finish won\u2019t be easy. \u201cI\u2019ve made it to provincials a couple times, and the best I\u2019ve placed is in the top 32,\u201d says Aubrey. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely competitive. You have to shoot your very best every single round.\u201d Following the provincial tournament, the league will be busy preparing to host the 12th annual Dan Cruickshank Memorial tournament. It is a nationally ranked event, which means players in the National Darts Federation of Canada will receive points for placing in the tournament. As a result, the tournament attracts high-calibre darts players. The Dan Cruickshank Memorial is the largest and most competitive tournament the league hosts. Last year, players from coast to coast travelled to Ottawa to compete, with the finals being broadcast on Rogers TV. While Aubrey's league has proven to be one of the most competitive in Ottawa, there are other reasons players are attracted to the organization. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a place where you come to play darts and improve your skills,\u201d says Adam Burton, one of the newest members. The game of darts is as much about the social aspect as it is about actually playing the game, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about meeting new people, making friends, and just having fun.\u201d ",

Instead, the team clinched a playoff spot with a commanding 5-1 win over the New York Islanders on April 1. They currently sit in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, and look poised for a first-round meeting with the defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins. The regular season ends Saturday and the playoffs are expected to begin next week.The city is now gearing up for a great cap to a surprising season.\u201cThis is really against all odds; we sure proved (them) wrong,\u201d says Lorne Geller, a Centretown resident and long-time Senators fan. \u201cUnlike last season, I\u2019m more inclined to go to a bar with friends now to watch games with other fans.\u201dSports bars and pubs in Centretown have experienced a slight increase in business this hockey season, albeit a modest one, business owners suggest. A playoff run, however, will only make things better, they say \u2013 especially when the city dubs Elgin Street the \u201cSens Mile\u201d as it did during previous playoff runs.\u201cWe won\u2019t see a noticeable increase in business until deeper in the playoffs,\u201d says Barrett Karam, manager of MacLaren\u2019s on Elgin. \u201cElgin Street being dubbed the \u2018Sens Mile\u2019 definitely creates an attractive location for Sens fans to migrate to.\u201dMore business is not the only benefit, though, says Gyneya Dicks, manager at Hooley\u2019s Pub at Elgin and MacLaren streets. \u201cPeople stay later, even after a game ends. The further they go, the better it is for business.\u201dJeff O\u2019Reilly, manager at D\u2019Arcy McGee\u2019s at Elgin and Sparks streets, remembers the team\u2019s run to the 2007 Stanley Cup final.\u00a0He does not expect the team to go as far this year, but says it is an example of what the Sens Mile can mean for local businesses.\u201cIt was exciting, and awesome, to see all the pride, the Sens jerseys,\u201d he says. \u201cIt definitely was a boon for us, and we hope to see something similar this year.\u201dLast year, the Sens did not make the playoffs, leaving sports bars across the city without the extra business of pint-happy fans.As of late March, there remained a chance the Senators would miss the playoffs following a string of four straight losses, leaving some fans hesitant to start celebrating.Even with star players Daniel Alfredsson and Jason Spezza missing from the crucial game against the Islanders, the Sens came out on top, giving fans the green light to celebrate.\u201cThe fact we\u2019ve come this far is great. The playoffs will only be the cherry on top, and make it that much better,\u201d Geller says.\u00a0He says he's grateful that the team\u2019s doubters have been chastened. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Senators are saying \u2018in your face\u2019 to them.\u201d",

The National Capital Commission is currently developing an application that visitors can download when they visit Parliament Hill. \r\r\u201cWhat\u2019s popular now is self-guided visits, so we want to ensure our visitors would be able to do that,\u201d says Charles Cardinal, a NCC communications advisor.The app will be launched this summer along with the first phase of a project to install descriptive plaques in front of the buildings and statues on Parliament Hill.\u201cNone of the 13 monuments or buildings presently have an interpretative panel,\u201d says Cardinal, adding that\u00a0 this makes it harder for visitors to roam around the national landmark without a tour guide.The plaques will feature key information about the historic personages depicted by the statues says Leslie Maitland, president of Heritage Ottawa.\u201cCanadians are frighteningly ignorant of their own history.\u201d says Maitland. \u201cI\u2019ll bet people stand in front of the statue of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and wonder who he was.\u201dSir Wilfrid Laurier was Canada\u2019s seventh prime minister.Cardinal says the project will be carried out in phases, starting with the statues of Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada\u2019s first prime minister and Queen Elizabeth. The plaque project is in line with the NCC\u2019s approach to change the way it delivers service to its visitors. \u201cWe are developing products for the near future,\u201d says Cardinal. This new approach allows the NCC to keep up to speed with the popular trends and allow visitors to use the tools they already have to enhance their trips to Canadian landmarks.Visitors using the app will find it easier to navigate through prime Centretown landmarks such as Parliament Hill, Rideau Hall, 24 Sussex and the national museums.Heritage Ottawa will also be involved in the development of the app to ensure that the best results are provided to the public.\u201cWe would like to see Canadians more knowledgeable about their history,\u201d says Maitland.The plaques will provide visitors with that knowledge. Over the next few years, all the prime tourist spots and statues on Parliament Hill will have a plaque to call its own. The NCC is taking small steps in the project as it wants to include visitor feedback says Cardinal.Maitland says that a lot of signage could be distracting, but Heritage Ottawa is in support of the pilot project and will be helping the NCC throughout the process.\u201cWe will see how the public reacts to them and make changes if necessary. The rest (of the plaques) will go up within the next few years,\u201d says Cardinal.Ashraf Adam, a tourist from Malaysia says that he feels he cannot appreciate the statues. \u201cThey must be here for a reason, and I know they look important.

What does that mean in terms of gender?\u201cLast year, we announced a season of plays that we\u2019re doing now . . . and they just happened to all be by men and no one said anything, It pointed out that we must also represent and celebrate the great work of women.\u201dHinton says he then made the conscious decision to produce a season of theatre made up of plays written only by women. He says studies show that the majority of theatre audience members are women, while less than a third of the plays produced are by female writers.\u201cWhile all of these works are by women \u2013 they\u2019re all thematically related in some way \u2013 we really strive for a lot of diversity and variety in the programming, too.\u201dHinton says the upcoming season will feature comedies, musicals, drama, as well as brand new works by Canadian artists.The series opens in October with Canadian Wendy Lill\u2019s The Glace Bay Miners\u2019 Museum, based on the novel by Sheldon Currie, about coal mining in Cape Breton, and continues with Jane Austen\u2019s classic Pride and Prejudice.

It\u2019s the continuum of care provided by community health centres that has proved to be most successful. \u201cIf you really want to attend to the issues, you have to look at people when they\u2019re well and starting to be ill, not just when they\u2019re in desperate need,\u201d Thibault says. \u201cYou have to start at the beginning, it makes sense.\u201dThe new ICES report compared seven different primary care models and found that CHCs \u201cstood out in their care of disadvantaged and sicker populations and had substantially lower emergency department visit rates than expected.\u201d \u201cThe (community health centre) model offers an attractive alternative in many respects, but (community health centres) serve a different role than the other primary care models and are resourced and governed quite differently,\u201d the report says. \u201cWhere they fit within primary care in Ontario should also be the subject of further policy consideration.\u201dThe report explains decision-makers in Ontario have unique opportunity to take its findings to re-orient resources and future investments, and to redesign their approach to primary care.\u201cOur emergency departments are overcrowded,\u201d says Dr. Richard Glazier, a senior scientist for ICES, and one of the authors of the report.Glazier says that even though it may cost a lot to run these centres, there can be significant savings elsewhere in the system. The province has been spending a great deal of money on other models of primary health care, like the family health network, that haven\u2019t provided the same savings. \u201cReally we have spent an incremental billion dollars a year for the last five years, it\u2019s not small potatoes,\u201d Glazier says. Last month, economist Don Drummond praised Community Health Centres. He reported that the health care system needed to be less hospital-centric and more community-based in order to help lift Ontario out of its $16 billion deficit. Drummond produced a report commissioned by the Ontario government, to revamp provincial public service. Drummond says health care should be shifting its attention from \u201cafter-the-problem treatment\u201d to health promotion. ",

Kony is the head of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, a Ugandan guerilla group that is said to have tortured and abducted thousands of children. The campaign began in early March when a video was released on Vimeo, a public media website similar to YouTube. The video has over 100 million views worldwide. The 30-minute video explains Kony\u2019s actions and lays out a plan of action in order to stop him. \u201cBasically, it\u2019s a 30-minute video that says who, what, where, when, why and how about everything Joseph Kony,\u201d says Patrick Martell, KONY 2012 organizer and volunteer. \u201cAnd Russell saves the best for last, the blueprint for the campaign.\u201dAmerican Jason Russell, Invisible Children\u2019s creator, directed the video. In the video, Russell says the ultimate goal of the campaign is to make Kony famous so \u201cculture makers\u201d and policymakers will want to act and stop his madness. To make him famous, on April 20, participants will Cover the Night by scattering around the city spreading posters of Joseph Kony so that the city will wake up and see Kony\u2019s face on every building in the city. KONY 2012 kits, which include bracelets and posters, were available to buy online, but demand is so high that the organization is no longer selling the kits and has instead made a downloadable version of the posters available on their website. This is not the first time Invisible Children tries to raise awareness about child soldiers. In 2009, Invisible Children held an event in Ottawa where protesters chained themselves together trying to symbolize the child soldiers marching in Uganda. Protesters marched from Parliament through the streets of Centretown before settling at LeBreton Flats, setting camp in front of the Canadian War Museum. The march attracted hundreds but activities were halted after gusty winds chased away most participants.Martell says Centretown will once again be the focus of the campaign, but says that no official route has been drawn for KONY 2012. Centretown resident Benoit Maranda participated in the 2009 event and says KONY 2012 will attract more people than 2009.\u201cThis will be huge. I think it will be double or triple the turnout this time than it was in 2009,\u201d says Maranda. \u201cI will be there for sure.\u201dThe campaign is controversial.In 2011, Invisible Children spent only 32 percent of their funds on their programs. The other 68 percent was spent on staff salaries, office rent and other expenses. Shortly after the release of the video, Russell was captured naked on video in San Diego screaming obscenities and pounding his fists in the middle of an intersection. An Invisible Children spokesperson said the incident was a result of dehydration and sleep deprivation. Russell has apologized for his actions. Despite the controversy, Martell says the event is still expected to be popular.Melanie Cartick, a Centretown resident, will not be participating in Cover the Night on April 20th and does not agree with Invisible Children\u2019s financial management, but says the campaign in the end is for a good cause.\u201cThis is a man who has to be stopped,\u201d says Cartick, a University of Ottawa student. \u201cThe objective of the campaign is good and I really hope it works.\u201d",

    "body": "ProvidedConst. Khoa N. HoangDowntown businesses shift their focus from indoor winter shopping to outdoor summer patios with the warmer weather. Many of us cannot resist the enticement of a downtown patio full of patrons, including me. But what if that noisy bar atmosphere was next door to you?\r\rUnfortunately, many of our downtown residents do not welcome patio season. The overwhelming constant noise of people yelling, doors slamming, and music blaring all hours of the night leaves much to be desired. Even more common are noisy neighbours. And downtown living reveals we have more noisy neighbours than any other district in our city.My recent search on the Ottawa Police Service computer revealed nothing surprising. Most noise complaints in our area are initiated in the Centretown bar district followed closely by Carleton University\u2019s Old Ottawa South community. The two neighbourhoods combined for a total of 23 per cent of all noise downtown complaints in 2011.Every summer, my office receives hundreds of noise complaints, many of which have escalated over years, dividing neighbours and raising tensions to uncontrollable levels. These are volatile scenarios. Large loud parties have a way of turning ugly in a blink of an eye and the combination of excessive drinking in large numbers can be dangerous.My experience tells me that renters are more likely than home owners to blast their music and that youths are far more likely to exceed acceptable sound levels than older adults. But don\u2019t lose hope, friends; there are recommendations that I have to help curb the tension among divided foes before the SWAT team enters that frat house.Relationships are everything in my business and they should also be the primary focus of every healthy community. Relationships establish respect and lead to trust. So it\u2019s important to remember a few basic rules to ensure neighbours get along during the 2012 party season.First, always get to know your neighbours. The Mere Exposure Theory states that the more we are exposed to a condition the more comfortable we become to that very condition. Same goes with people! So get to know each other as often as possible, so that when one person crosses the line both sides are more likely to make accommodations and resolve the conflict.The second rule and one that has always benefited me is to always notify your neighbours two weeks in advance of an expected loud party. This courtesy allows all affected residents to plan for the event and conveniently promotes the first rule!Finally, keep your loud parties reasonable. Nobody wants to rain on your parade and stop you from having fun, but if you can\u2019t control everyone at the party then don\u2019t have that many people. Music should also be turned off at a reasonable time; if you live downtown music should not be blasting until the early morning.If those three simple rules are too much to ask and I understand that they are for many people, then expect a bylaw complaint from the neighbours. You can do this by dialing 3-1-1 which will be redirected to OPS if bylaw is no longer working or the situation is potentially dangerous. Offenders may be fined almost $400 per visit and our city councillors have made it clear that this type of complaint is serious. Officers will attend the scene for assessment and callers can ask to be anonymous.However, there is the potential for you to be called to court if the fined subject pleas \u201cnot guilty\u201d so making notes would help prove your case. Of course, all this could be avoided if neighbours took the time to establish a trusting relationship and promoted respect for one another as all healthy communities do.",

The rationale is that it is much simpler to charge these groups than picking out individual offenders.\u201cIt is by far the largest problem for us,\u201d Sandy Hill resident Andr\u00e9 Longtin told the meeting.

It is difficult to enforce bylaws when offenders migrate through town. Many advised staff to better communicate with universities to get students to tone it down. Still, the speakers voiced their support for a bylaw that will help bring down the decibel level in Ottawa and do it as soon as possible.Sandy Hill isn\u2019t the only neighbourhood that has noise complaints.

    "body": "The preliminary groundwork \u2013 beginning way back in 2008 with the appearance of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) after the closing credits to Iron Man \u2013 has been extensive, even unprecedented.\r\rThe stakes \u2013 the popularity of all Marvel Studios\u2019 name-brand comic-book properties \u2013 could not be higher.The Avengers\u00a0Directed by Joss WhedonStarring Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johanssen, Jeremy Renner, Clark Gregg, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Gwyneth PaltrowBut the rewards for Marvel, which opened its first superhero ensemble picture over the weekend to a record-setting debut, are likely to be immense, even before merchandising enters the equation.Initially discernible as a vague idea bridging movies and storylines (mostly in the form of Nick Fury cameos), The Avengers seemed, by the time of Iron Man 2\u2019s release, to be an influence to which these other films \u2013 standalone blockbusters in their own right \u2013 were partly or even wholly subordinated.But with Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanssen), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) finally all in the same room \u2013 and later in the same battle \u2013 Marvel\u2019s ambitious gambit has paid off in spades in the currency of sheer delight at the sense of a sprawling, contiguous universe that spans years, movies, characters and worlds.Disaster looms when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor\u2019s brother, returns to earth, stealing the Tesseract retrieved from the seabed in Captain America: The First Avenger, and using his godly powers to seize control of human agents who will be useful to him, including Hawkeye and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd).Nick Fury, realizing humanity is defenseless against the army of alien warriors Loki plans to unleash against the world, hastens to assemble his team; but with their checkered histories, incompatible personalities, and egos to match their superpowers, the Avengers have some distance to go from their starting point as a fighting unit.Rogers still has culture shock from waking up in modernity. Thor, naively, would rather reason with his brother than bludgeon him. Stark, who was never vetted to be on the team, has trouble with authority. Banner, who was working as a doctor in India in hiding from the government, just wants to avoid turning green and destroying everything in sight. And Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, has her hands full repaying a debt to the brainwashed Hawkeye by not letting him succeed in Loki\u2019s machinations.Director Joss Whedon keeps the pace brisk and never lets a bland millisecond grow into a dull moment, weaving recap seamlessly together with brand-new backstory, mining superhuman characters for their most human qualities and always with an eye for the overall structure, a pleasing if ponderous totality with buttresses of ample humour and cantilevers of adrenaline-soaked comic-book combat.Enhancing the sense of overarching continuity are a group of past supporting characters along for the ride, including Dr. Selvig, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Fury associate Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), to whom it falls to serve as heavy-handed geek surrogate.The fundamental motivation for The Avengers is the same as the impulse at the core of The Expendables: assemble the most awesome warriors around and unleash them in the direction of the biggest, baddest threat on offer. It is truly a treat to see these characters together at last, and there is plenty of time for everyone to shine.Hulk\u2019s unbridled gorilla fury, in particular, is a cathartic trigger that gives rise to a couple of the film\u2019s best moments, one of them in which Dr. Banner\u2019s big green \u201cother guy\u201d threatens a teammate; his inclusion, as both the Avengers\u2019 and the film\u2019s secret weapon, adds an element of tension associated with the fact that while Banner\u2019s intent can always be trusted, his explosive Hulk alter ego is as dangerous and unpredictable as nitroglycerine.Logic lapses here and there, but the major drawback is the overwhelmingly generic race of antagonistic aliens mobilized by Loki for a battle in which exciting, character-driven moments compete for attention with the sound and fury of a Transformers-league demolition derby. There is a lack of narrative ebb and flow to the combat, and enacted by these disappointing stock villains \u2013 who really might as well be Power Rangers \u2018Putties\u2019 \u2013 it is surely less climactic than envisioned.In large part, however, The Avengers is everything an audience could ask for, and in crisply serviceable 3D. Given the amount of time and energy \u2013 the sheer amount of story \u2013 that went into setting up this particular film, it is impossible to blame Marvel for jumping at such a low-risk, high-reward proposition (and, to their credit, the risk is low only now, in hindsight).With Iron Man 3 due out next year, catalyzing \u201cphase two of this saga that will culminate, God willing, in Avengers 2,\u201d it only remains to be seen where they will go next. Fans are recommended to wait in the theatre until the end of the credits.\u00a0",

She has a strong personality, a good sense of humour, and has lived alone since her husband died years ago. In many ways, she reminds me of my grandmother who was equally independent and active within the community.\r\rLast month, someone decided to tag the side of my neighbour\u2019s house with black spray paint. Shortly afterwards, a second tag appeared with blue spray paint. Being a good neighbour and police officer, I provided her with one of our graffiti removal kits (free at my office) which she used to remove the unsightly tags.Within a week, three tags replaced the two that were recently removed. This not only made me angry but my natural protective side kicked in wanting to catch the person who would intentionally target such an innocent vulnerable member of our society.Graffiti is a big problem in our city for both residential and commercial properties. It\u2019s a bigger problem than most people are aware of and cost all of us millions of dollars every single year. Graffiti is not a victimless crime. If left unattended it can spread and create a domino effect that will create more difficult problems to solve.Criminals who commit mischief by graffiti believe they have a right to claim that territory. The subculture within the graffiti community is very strong and often leads to violent encounters among criminals who disrespect each other\u2019s work. Tagging over someone else\u2019s graffiti is considered disrespectful, which is ironic considering the crime itself.The individuals that I\u2019ve arrested have shown no remorse for their actions and have a skewed belief that every property is available to be claimed through tagging. This includes property such as mail boxes, street signs, buildings, buses, and even highways. This anti-social culture dictates that the higher risk of getting caught equals a higher level of respect among the graffiti community.I have no patience with these misguided criminals, typically youths who are seeking acceptance and self- esteem, who target our neighbourhood without care or consideration. The reality is that by the time our police officers arrest one suspect, 50 properties have been damaged costing everyone thousands in repair. Business owners are forced to remove the graffiti immediately by the City of Ottawa, or face an automatic bill for the removal work.Some business owners simply can\u2019t afford to pay $500 every week to have new graffiti removed. Unfortunately, they are forced into making the regular cleanup or face expensive fines. Either way, it affects our economy leaving hard working owners to clean up a mess they did not make. The Ottawa Police Service would like to empower our residents to take charge! It\u2019s true, the quicker graffiti is removed from an area the least likely it is to return. These misfits can\u2019t claim a property among the graffiti subculture if no one sees their work.Public transportation services belonging to Canadians suffer millions in loss revenue every year due to mischief. Toronto\u2019s TTC spends a whopping $5 million annually because of mischief and OC Transpo reports budgeting a significant amount for similar repairs.Crime Stoppers (1-800-222-TIPS) is an excellent service to use if you have information to give but want to remain anonymous. They even have an online service (crimestoppers.ca) to make submitting information quick and easy.The City of Ottawa has a Graffiti Management Team, which should be contacted immediately to report any case of graffiti by calling 3-1-1 or email them at \n \n <!--\n var prefix = '&#109;a' + 'i&#108;' + '&#116;o';\n var path = 'hr' + 'ef' + '=';\n var addy62947 = 'gr&#97;ff&#105;t&#105;m&#97;n&#97;g&#101;m&#101;nt' + '&#64;';\n addy62947 = addy62947 + '&#111;tt&#97;w&#97;' + '&#46;' + 'c&#97;' + '&#46;' + '';\n document.write( '<a ' + path + '\\'' + prefix + ':' + addy62947 + '\\'>' );\n document.write( addy62947 );\n document.write( '<\\/a>' );\n //-->\\n \n <!--\n document.write( '<span style=\\'display: none;\\'>' );\n //-->\n This e-mail address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view it\n \n <!--\n document.write( '</' );\n document.write( 'span>' );\n //-->\n \u00a0 It\u2019s important to do so because tracking graffiti is half the battle to identifying the next potential target.Our police officers utilize the information you provide to set up undercover operations. Last year, we conducted regular projects that yield multiple arrests every time we went out. But enforcement alone has never been enough to reduce criminal activity.

The CDP allows for buildings up to 25 storeys, but the Centretown Citizens Community Association says that is still too high.. Centretown residents and community groups generally supported the new community design plan at a public meeting Wednesday, but also had questions and recommendations for those behind the plan.\r\rThe Centretown Citizens Community Association hosted the meeting at the McNabb Community Centre, attended by about 150 residents, so the public could ensure the plan reflected their vision for Centretown. City staff, community leaders, Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes, and the CDP team leader, George Dark, also attended. \u201cThe community association supports getting the community design plan approved by council,\u201d said the CCCA\u2019s Judy Forrest.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to get this plan completed and approved because we need a framework that is going to be respected going forward,\u201d she said.Forrest praised the plan\u2019s \u201cgreat vision statements\u201d for the future look of Centretown. Still, she and the CCCA want to see some changes. They still believe building heights are too tall in some areas. For example, in the plan\u2019s designated apartment neighbourhood zone, some buildings reach as high as 27 storeys.Another problem lies in what the association believes is too much emphasis placed on mixed-use, meaning commercial and residential space in the same area. For example, in the apartment neighbourhood zone, much of a building\u2019s floor area could be used for non-residential purposes on the first few storeys, but the CCCA wants to see more residential use on these ground floors.The Centretown Citizens Ottawa Corporation, an affordable housing provider, wants to see the city sign off on the plan as soon as possible, but the CDP should promote a neighbourhood where residents can live for life, from youth to retirement.Heritage Ottawa said more attention should have been paid to less prominent but equally important Centretown heritage resources. Echoing Forrest\u2019s concerns, some Centretown residents were outraged that the old plan\u2019s guidelines were not followed. Centretown is seeing many high-rise buildings that the original plan does not permit. Applications for new high-rise condos that do not respect the current plan are being approved by council.\u201cMaking sure that the guidelines are followed is critical to where the city of Ottawa is going in the future,\u201d said one resident to applause.\u201cThe question asked tonight is: is this plan going to stick?\u201d Holmes said in an interview after the meeting. \u201cIs the city going to take it seriously and live by it?\u201d The new draft of the CDP will be revised over the summer and early fall, taking into account comments from the community and from developers.

    "body": "In 1979, director Ridley Scott piloted the horror genre into space with the groundbreaking Alien, sowing seeds of a distinct mythology that would breed decades\u2019 worth of sequels, cross-overs, novels, and comics.\r\rWith Sir Ridley finally returning to the franchise he began, it is only fitting that Prometheus concerns itself above all with creators and their creations, the myriad variations on their interrelationship, and the utterly human need to make some kind of sense of it all.Prometheus\u00a0Directed by Ridley ScottStarring Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, Logan Marshall-GreeneLess a prequel than an expansion of the existing mythology, Prometheus follows a team of scientists to a distant solar system mapped in cave paintings and prehistoric art around the world, their quest nothing less than to find the source, if not the meaning, of all life.Our adventurers touch down on a habitable moon and discover enormous structures containing warrens of tunnels where they find countless canisters of black goo, the corpses of towering humanoids dubbed Engineers, and depictions of seemingly human faces as well as the distinctive Alien xenomorph.Atmospheric and thrilling, underpinned by the characters\u2019 obvious questions \u2013 What happened here? How does it relate to humanity? What more will we find? \u2013 these scenes unfold effectively in lush 3D.But in stories like these, the answers can never be as satisfying as the questions are compelling. Knowing this, Prometheus willfully dissembles; the promise of its early ambition goes unfulfilled as the alloy of science-fiction and spiritual truth-seeking disintegrates, leaving a hodge-podge of horror tropes, curtailed character arcs, and too-quick shock deaths.A crew of 17 is simply too many for a movie like this to invest with individual personalities \u2013 though any real such expedition would surely require a far larger work force \u2013 so a number of characters (including those played by Kate Dickie and Benedict Wong) simply float by in the periphery.At the forefront is archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), discoverer of the cave paintings, who wears a cross around her neck \u2013 explained needlessly in an early dream sequence \u2013 and literally wants to meet her maker, with her boyfriend and colleague Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), the impetuous atheist, in tow.Charlie is not the kind of person you would find on a trillion-dollar mission to the other end of space, but neither is anyone else on this spaceship, which is why, even as their eventual deaths are a foregone conclusion, their introductions are surprising.First seen awaking from two years in a comatose stasis, the classic \u201cmotley band\u201d of scientists and crew members exhibit no memory of having been introduced to each other or their mission, yet here they are, with seeming sociopaths pointlessly among them.Captain Janek (Idris Elba), a no-nonsense stevedore-type, has no apparent interest in the nature of the mission he is flying, though he later serves up what is either the film\u2019s most human moment or its lamest. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), on hand to make sure everything follows the plan, is the icy representative of Weyland Corporation \u2013 whose ancient CEO, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), appears in holographic form to brief everyone.But the most interesting character is the android David (Michael Fassbender), a sort of synthetic adoptive son to Peter Weyland. While the humans sleep their hypersleep, David passes time performing maintenance checks, watching Lawrence of Arabia, and peering in on the dreams of his charges. With an agenda all his own and a curious link to Meredith Vickers, David is both the apex of human achievement and the undoing of the mission; Fassbender is a delight to watch in the role.Perhaps the blame lies with Lost alumnus and co-writer Damon Lindelof as opposed to director Scott himself, but for a film about answers \u2013 all the characters seem to talk about is \u201cfinding answers\u201d \u2013 Prometheus is curiously bereft of revelation. In fact, nearly everything learnt in the movie is concisely conveyed in its two-minute trailers, which leaves an awful lot of time for slow-boil horror and pseudo-philosophical meandering.Yet that is precisely what Scott must have concerned himself with throughout production, because the plot is a vessel adrift with neither rhyme nor reason at the helm (only their secretary, Mr. Lindelof, who obviously has no idea how to pilot the thing). Amid the gorgeous cinematography and set design, there are elements that almost seem designed to rip you out of the beautiful illusion.Two scientists get lost for hours while being tracked on a holographic maps; they never lose radio contact but don\u2019t ask for directions. Characters repeatedly fail to tell one another urgently important truths and to ask obvious questions. Even with Janek, Vickers, and two pilots to monitor communications, nobody ever seems to know what is happening inside this one small ship.The Engineers pilot their own spacecraft with a supercomputer activated by the sound of a wooden flute. (No joke.) There is in the musical score, intermittently rearing its head, a swelling motif that emulates Star Trek but does not fit Prometheus at all. And so on.But despite a general inability to make sense, let alone live up to its own promise of provoking thought, Prometheus does offer moments of profundity.After they discover the Engineers and do genetic testing, Charlie suggests Elizabeth can stop wearing her cross, because they have their answers: Engineers made humanity. Her response is to wonder who made the Engineers.When Charlie tells David that humans made synthetic life simply \u201cbecause we could,\u201d the android asks how he would feel to hear the same thing from his own creator.Drenched in atmosphere, Prometheus satisfies on the genre front with intermittent doses of alien scares, body horror, and other grotesqueries. But it overestimates its own grandiosity in moments of loftiness, and that certain something more \u2013 promised with increasing confidence as the marketing campaign evolved \u2013 is never really present.The overall evasiveness has been interpreted in some quarters as teasing a sequel, but that in turn seems to miss the point of there being unanswerable questions.",

It was a beautiful Saturday in Dundonald Park attended by approximately 600 people. Organized by the incredible volunteers of our Somerset Community Police Centre, the day was an astounding success!\r\rChief Bordeleau welcomed the crowd and the drumming of Ota-Wa Taiko promptly began at noon, bringing more and more neighbours out of their homes and into the park with every beat. \u201cI heard the drumming and came out to see what was going on,\u201d said local resident Katie Layng.Katie, like most Ottawa residents, had little interactions with the police until that day. But she called her mother who lived up the street, who called her neighbour, who emailed the downtown parents group. Within an hour of the event starting, our team of organizers initiated an emergency backup plan called \u201cOperation-More-Hotdogs\u201d. Doubling our original estimation of 200 guests and immediately purchasing enough food for 500 people, even that wasn\u2019t enough!But no one cared that the food ran out or that there were no more balloons. They were simply impressed that the Ottawa Police Service took time out of their busy schedules to build a meaningful relationship with the community they serve. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer good enough to just meet a police officer\u201d, I said at a recent event, \u201cMeaningful, trusting relationships require effort. So that you know your officers will be there when you need us, and we know you\u2019ll be there when we need you.\u201dThe community policing model is one that focuses on long-term sustainable solutions. Responding to stop a crime in progress is one thing, but reducing overall crimes in high-demand areas is preferred.\u00a0 If there were ever any doubts that it works, just pay a visit to Dundonald Park where there are less service calls today than there were two years ago. There are fewer drunks, less fights, and more community members taking ownership of what\u2019s rightfully theirs.After overwhelming calls for service to Dundonald Park peaked in 2010, the Ottawa Police Service initiated a strategy of suppression and enforcement along with community initiative and social service intervention. We made all parks within our downtown neighbourhoods a priority in 2011, sending more police officers there than in the past.But enforcement alone has never been enough, so I got to work building networks of community partners that would work together to develop initiatives that would sustain an acceptable level of safety for our neighbours. Today, Dundonald Park receives regular use from residents including yoga in the park, tai chi lessons, dance classes, weekend movies in the park, and a wide range of other initiatives to promote positive use and reduce the need for police intervention.We live in an increasingly pessimistic society with cell phone cameras that show evidence of why we should never trust each other. But I\u2019ve never been one for cynics. Trust is absolutely essential to our culture and can even define quality; quality of life, community, and policing.New corporate supporters have emerged for next year\u2019s event, community partners demand another invite, and our residents anxiously wait for more. Subscriptions to the Somerset CPC newsletter have increased by 10 per cent this month alone, making sure readers don\u2019t miss out on other opportunities to build meaningful relationships with our members.For more information, please visit: www.somersetcpc.com.",

Keeping Mayfield\u2019s vision alive for 80 years has been almost as difficult as bringing it to life in the middle of the Great Depression.The slight and sickly Mayfield \u2013 a veteran of the First World War \u2013 arrived in Ottawa after travelling throughout Canada and the U.S. He felt the effect of the depression during his travels and set about finding a way to help Ottawa\u2019s most disadvantaged. Mayfield played a role in establishing Goodwill chapters in Vancouver and Winnipeg but no local church, social club, or other institution wanted to help him set up shop in the capital. It wasn\u2019t until Parkdale United Church showed interest in spreading welfare goods around town that Mayfield was able to move forward with his dream project. He eventually found support from a local club to help him launch a Goodwill chapter in Ottawa.Mayfield worked out of a small rented store, collecting goods and reselling them at affordable prices. His Goodwill chapter eventually adopted the name Ottawa Neighbourhood Services.Like today, ONS employed few full-time staff. Mayfield even put his wife to work as a bookkeeper for his newfound charity. Despite his ill health, Mayfield was dedicated to establishing goodwill roots in the capital. Even if he often wondered if all the hardships and setbacks were really worth it, he said he, his wife, and the few ONS workers \u2013 who might be unemployed if not for Mayfield \u2013 had \u201ca very rich and full life.\u201dLemieux has been the president of ONS for 12 years.\u00a0 She remembers her weekend visits to ONS when she was young. \u201cWe\u2019d come down on Saturdays and we got used to getting up in the morning. And we kind of made it a Saturday ritual,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there are still a lot of people that come here every Saturday. They stand outside the door just to get in to get the deals, get the bargains.\u201dWhen her husband died in the mid-90s, she donated many personal items to ONS, which was going through a series of financial problems and had plans to close. Even though Lemieux was in the middle of settling her late husband\u2019s affairs, she asked her lawyer and accountant to help out the struggling not-for-profit. They joined ONS board members and the Ottawa community in keeping ONS operational.\u201cI\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve been able to be around for the past 12 years because certainly there have been a lot of ups-and-downs, a lot of changes,\u201d she says, \u201cbut for the most part, I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re able to still assist the community and continue to help that community.\u201dTheir 80th anniversary celebration will not see the opening of a sister store or the hiring of 30 new employees. They are relying on this event to help them get by \u2013 to help pay their rent, put gas in their truck, and reach another milestone.\u201cWe\u2019re back on track,\u201d she says. \u201cWe still have a long way to go. It\u2019s good that Ottawa Neighbourhood Services overcame the situation because instead of lasting 69 years, we\u2019ve managed to bring it into its 80th year for celebrations. So it\u2019s a happy time for Ottawa Neighbourhood Services now.\u201d The Centretown community can expect a barbecue, a big outdoor sale, a silent and a live auction, face painting, music, and a raffle for two Bluesfest passes. Mayor Jim Watson will cut the cake at the June 30 celebration, to be held at the City Centre shop. \u201cIf everything goes well, I think we\u2019ll do very well in the event,\u201d says Lemieux. \u201cHopefully, the community will join in and continue with their support to us.\u201dWatch the video.

In the area near Claridge\u2019s Tribeca development, the ground has somewhat sunk and settled. The committee wanted another study conducted but planning department officials said today the ground settlement levels in the area are normal.Troy Skinner of Golder Associates, the firm that consulted on the project, said conditions at the Tribeca site are different from those at 96 Nepean. There is less sensitive soil, for example. Skinner said construction of Tribeca is not impacting 96 Nepean.The application\u2019s greenlight came after some back-and-forth discussion about the geology of the site as well as strong opposition from Centretown community leaders.Joan Spice, representing the Centretown Citizens Community Association, as well as Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes, voiced their opposition to the development.Spice said the building is not following all guidelines laid out in the draft community design plan. Any buildings that do not follow these rules, she said, should not be approved. But the planning department said the proposal does generally follow the draft CDP.\u201cIt\u2019s a massive development for a very small site,\u201d said Holmes.

The relationship between Ottawa folk rock band Kalle Mattson and the crowd that gathered at their July 6 Bluesfest performance can best be described as \u201cThick as Thieves\u201d \u2013 one of the group\u2019s biggest songs. \r\rListeners should be \u201cCrazy yet reserved when both are needed,\u201d Kalle Wainio, the Centretown vocalist behind the band, said in an interview before the show. And they were. An enthusiastic crowd built up as Kalle Mattson played some of their signatures and some new material \u2013 but as Wainio told his fans, it\u2019s not new to them.Wainio even spurred on fans and newcomers throughout the show.\u201cIt\u2019s an awesome festival. It\u2019s really fun,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people see the show and they dig it, that\u2019s the best right there. That\u2019s all you can hope for.\u201dThe band formed around Wainio\u2019s songs but some of the boys from Sault Ste. Marie moved to Ottawa and welcomed some locals to make up the group. This is not Kalle Mattson\u2019s first time taking Bluesfest. They were part of the 2011 lineup as well and had a decent turnout, but Wainio said their slot was not so great. They weren\u2019t following Hamilton\u2019s rock band Arkells that year.The crowds have gotten bigger since one of the band\u2019s music videos went viral in November 2011, racking up over one million views and garnering the Ottawa indie group international acclaim and coverage in Time Magazine and CBS News. The short video is a comic animation of the history of the world set to the quirky and romantic \u201cThick as Thieves.\u201d The three-and-a-half-minute short, made on a paltry $250 budget, also got the attention of the National Post, which called them one of five bands poised to break out in 2012. But what does \u201cbreaking out\u201d mean for Wainio?\u201cI\u2019m not sure what that means either,\u201d he said. But he thinks real success would be to just play his own songs and make a comfortable living doing it \u2013 every musician\u2019s dream. \u201cIt\u2019s not about selling a million records,\u201d he said, and it\u2019s just not reasonable, but to put out what he has in just over three years is itself an accomplishment.Centretown News was given a preview of their upcoming new stop-motion short for \u201cWater Falls.\u201d Wainio was right when he said it\u2019s not as cutesy as their last sleeper hit. But it still has the quirks the indie band\u2019s fans might expect, with the lyrics, \u201cLike a water fall, I watch life pass you by\u201d matched with stop-motion of San Francisco\u2019s real-life landmarks passing by the constantly moving camera.Wainio just wants people to listen to their music. This is why all of the group\u2019s tracks are free for download. For small indies, it\u2019s the right route to take. Kalle Mattson has a new record set to bow in August and the band will be on a full-fledged west coast tour come October.",

And maybe even chill with Down with Webster.\r\rKeek is made up of lead singer Conor Whitehead, bassist Matt Belanger, guitarists Marek Luban and Mitch Malboeuf, Kyle Williams on keys, and Kyle Megill on drums. Most of the six-man troupe shares in the vocals too.\u201cI\u2019m just hoping to see a lot of new people who are into it,\u201d says Belanger. The pop rock band always interacts with an enthusiastic crowd and they want the same from the audience at their Bluesfest debut. \u201cYou remember when you\u2019re inside your room trying to write down these words and what they meant to you,\u201d says Luban. \u201cAnd then it gets to a point where people you don\u2019t even know are singing them back to you. It\u2019s crazy. I would love to see that.\u201dThey learned a lot on their first tour. They sometimes found their music style didn\u2019t mesh well with some audiences and it took them a while to find their crowd. But they still try to make the best of a slot regardless.

A few months ago, the band\u2019s pop rock act even won over some metal heads at a show.\u00a0 \u201cI love getting home from shows and seeing messages from people who you\u2019ve never met before who are saying, \u2018I\u2019ve never seen you guys before but I really loved it,\u2019\u201d recalls Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool to spark those new relationships with people who started off as total strangers.\u201dAnd what about meeting up with other bands? \u201cDown with Webster seems like they have some pretty sweet personalities,\u201d says Luban. \u201cIt would be awesome to chill with them for a little bit, maybe.\u201dKeek will play a 45-minute set of new songs on their July 8 Bluesfest bow. They played a set at Canada Day, opening for Kim Mitchell, but the band is not used to playing a long track lineup.

It was a reasonable change as the folky City and Colour were set to perform on the main stage later that night.\r\rThe first on my list of people to see and hear was Ottawa\u2019s Kalle Mattson on the River Stage. Kalle Mattson played a lively folk-rock set to a small but growing crowd. At one point, Kalle Wainio even got them to clap along during a new song. They were a perfect compliment to the Arkells, who performed afterwards.The Arkells received excited cheers from the young crowd as they stepped on stage. There was one young dedicated fan who made his mom wait with him an hour and a half before they were set to perform. They gave a solid performance which included the popular, \u201cThe Ballad of Hugo Chavez.\u201d As I was making my way to catch more music on other stages, I could hear them work the Black Keys\u2019 \u201cLonely Boy\u201d into one of their songs.Between Kalle Mattson and the Arkells, I managed to catch the end of Freelance Whales performing at the Claridge Homes stage. The quirky indie band from New York had the largest crowd during the early evening slot. They received a few rousing cheers as they announced they were going to play, what I assumed, was one of their most notable songs. Freelance Whales entertained the crowd with their upbeat, catchy, and almost Vampire Weekend-like music.The vibe around the main area dropped as City and Colour took to the stage. Dallas Green of City and Colour was greeted by a large crowd in their late teens and twenties. The music was slower and quieter, characteristics that were enhanced by the sound bleeding over from the loud dance-punk music of Sleigh Bells on the other stage. It also highlighted the fact that Green\u2019s melodic and folky tunes seemed more appropriate in a smaller, more intimate venue, not a large stage in an open field. In the time I watched him, Green barely moved away from his mic stand. At one point of his performance, he asked the audience to turn off their cellphones, a request I doubt anyone heeded. I overhead an older gentleman saying Green was \u201cthe poor man\u2019s Dylan.\u201dWhile Green sang his songs just fine, Charles Bradley and the Extraordinares grabbed my attention and pulled me away to the Blacksheep stage. The soul singer had the hands-down best stage presence of that night. He moved across the stage like a man younger than his 64 years, commandeering the attention of both the young and old. He would dance here with moves that only he could ever pull off. Among his repertoire of dance moves were what I like to call \u201cthe eagle\u201d (flapping his arms up and down), and throwing his mic too quickly to catch it again after pulling on the cord. His energy was just as infectious as watching James Brown perform. At the end of the night, Bradley jumped off stage and hugged everyone at the front of the crowd, thanking them for coming out. To see someone with that much energy and enthusiasm even after performing on the main stage the night before was a pleasure.To see more photos from Bluesfest, check out the gallery HERE  .  ",

The lineup at Bluesfest on Saturday was as diverse as ever, as gospel, electronic and classic rock seeped from just about every corner. It was obvious, though, that heavy metal dominated the day as a huge mass of people waited patiently around the Main Stage for Alice Cooper and Iron Maiden.\r\rThere were even a couple of fans dressed up as Alice Cooper, complete with dramatic black eye makeup and black top hats. Luckily, their efforts were not ignored. Their enthusiasm and excitement was matched by the theatricality of both Alice Cooper and Iron Maiden.It was evident how over-the-top Cooper\u2019s show would be even before he stepped on the stage. A large curtain with his face painted on it covered the set, and a creepy Chucky-like doll poked out from behind. Cooper stepped on stage with spider-arms coming out from his sides, performing on top of a staircase for all his fans to see. His costume was appropriate enough as he opened the show with \u201cThe Black Widow.\u201dCooper would bring out elaborate props and change into different costumes throughout his whole set. He sang one song with a snake around his arm, had a fencing sword loaded with fake money during another, and even changed into a bloody lab coat for \u201cFeed My Frankenstein.\u201d There was also a beheading skit. At one point, his female guitarist grabbed everyone\u2019s attention with an amazing guitar solo that had the crowd cheering. Cooper definitely knows his audience and even wore an Ottawa Senators jersey. The theatricality of it all made for an enjoyable experience.For a slight change of pace, the Claridge Homes Stage provided some classic rock as The Bright Light Social Hour took to the stage. The long-haired rockers had me feeling as if I was in the movie Almost Famous with their seventies-like rock. My favourite song had to be \u201cDetroit.\u201d It had a more of a sixties R&B/ blues feel as they belted out the lyrics, \u201cI need your love,\u201d and built up their own wall of sound.Heading back to the Main Stage to see Iron Maiden felt like journeying to Mordor as it was an impossible task to get close enough to see anything. I wish I could describe what happened, but trying to look over the top of heads and outstretched arms was difficult. I did manage to catch one of the guitarists with one of his legs on an amp. It was an impressive feat of flexibility, considering he had to be older than fifty. There were a lot of pyrotechnics but feelings of claustrophobia began to set in and I headed over to watch MSTRKRFT at the Electro Stage.On my way there, the scene was drastically different at the Black Sheep stage as lawn chairs were lined up across the field. Older watchers and parents with young children filled those seats waiting for more gospel music.I was mildly curious to see MSTRKRFT perform. Their set quickly became a smoke and lights show, clouding the two group members. While they dramatically turned knobs and moved sliders here and there (as seen from the monitors), a huge crowd of people began dancing like mad men. I even saw one middle-aged man dancing the night away without a shirt.At the end of the night, I felt as if I was in some sort of odd machine as the scenery changed as I moved from stage to stage. It made for a great eye-opening experience.For pictures from Saturday click HERE.  ",

    "body": "Portia Baladad, Centretown NewsSeal performing at Bluesfest. LeBreton Flats on Sunday felt like every parent's dream come true. The lineup on Sunday had to be the most family-friendly lineup of the whole weekend. There was literally something for every member of the family. While the kids could enjoy themselves at the Electro and River Stages, parents seemed to be in the land of date-night as R&B singer Seal and blues/ jazz artist Norah Jones headlined the night. \r\rEarlier that day, Ottawa pop band Keek performed on the River Stage. Keek played a small crowd which included a few dedicated Down with Webster fans who wanted to grab good spots. Luckily for Keek, their brand of bubble gum pop wasn\u2019t a far stretch from DWW. Keek's lead singer bounced from one end of the stage to the other, and they seemed to have pleased the small young crowd. Those who were over the age of 15, on the the other hand, didn\u2019t seem as entertained.They probably would\u2019ve been better off watching Jeff Rogers and the All Day Daddies over on the Main Stage. Rogers and company had a great mix of R&B, soul, and blues that had the crowd swaying to and fro. If at the right venue, I could definitely see couples starting to pair off and slow dance their way through Rogers\u2019 set because it was the kind of music you could fall in love to.Parents also would\u2019ve enjoyed James Vincent McMorrow at the Blacksheep stage. The folky musician kept it simple with him and his guitar, but the sparse set-up proved to be enough as he entranced everyone around him. His raspy voice was low and full of emotion other than general excitement, which was a nice change of pace from the usual hyped up vibe of Bluesfest. The Blacksheep stage worked in his favour as the smaller open area felt just as intimate as if we were in a small, dark venue. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if McMarrow gains a large Ottawa following as the crowd shouted praise for the humble musician.Just before Seal was set to perform on the Claridge Stage, The Wooden Sky warmed the crowd with their indie, country-rock style. The Toronto band drew in a large, diverse crowd and kept it interesting with their slow music. At one point, the keyboards felt a little too screechy and overpowered the vocals during \u201cCity of Light.\u201dThough, the highlight of the night had to be Seal. Near the beginning of his set I overheard one woman tell her friend that \u201cthis is getting sexy real quick,\u201d and it truly was. Seal was working that stage with what I would describe as \u201ccampy, sexy\u201d dance moves. He worked those hips, and got close to his fans as risers connected the stage to the crowd. It seemed like he had just about every middle-aged woman in the crowd melting as he performed some of his older nineties R&B tracks. (Just a side note for those few who aren\u2019t married: Seal is single again.) Unfortunately for me, I had to skip out near the end of his set and missed \u201cKiss from a Rose,\u201d my karaoke favourite. It was the only Seal song I knew, and I\u2019m still angry that I missed it.Chromeo\u2019s set was slightly disappointing especially after gaining a new appreciation for live DJing after seeing MSTRKRFT the night before. First off, Chromeo began late. Then, later on into the night, it just felt like some playlist DJing was happening as he switched from one popular song to the next.I ended my night with Norah Jones. Luckily, I didn\u2019t miss out on a very well done performance of \u201cCome Away with Me.\u201d Jones, who was accompanied by a band for her set, was alone on stage for this number. She slowed the song down even more, and holding on to each note just a little longer. Her voice was buttery smooth and beautiful. She tried her best to interact with the crowd, even taking suggestions for new band names. Yet, her charisma couldn\u2019t hold me there much longer afterward.For more photos from Sunday, click HERE.  ",

    "body": "Is James Street Pub located in Centretown or in \u201cSouth Central?\u201d The protesters stationed outside last night demanded the retention of the century-old name while condo developers and their supporters threw a party inside the pub to herald the \u201claunch\u201d of the new moniker.  \r\rToronto developer Urban Capital Property Group\u2019s effort to rebrand the area \u2013 albeit with a chicer twist than the Los Angeles \u2018hood of the same name \u2013 has been underway for some time and has already seen downtown blanketed with ads emblazoned with the new name. The logo \u201cSouth Central\u201d would apply from Catherine to Somerset streets along Bank \u2013 the area around the developer\u2019s new condo buildings.The protesters, armed with drums, a megaphone, and other noisemakers, tried to stop the party. And their disruption was about much more than the name. They said the raising of swanky condos will turn the area south of Somerset into a sort of playground for the rich.\u201cPart of the rebranding strategy is the erasure of the community that already lives here,\u201d said Priscillia Mosher of the anti-poverty group Under Pressure. \u201cCondo companies will buy property in places where poor people live because the prices are cheap and then they\u2019ll rebrand the entire community, pushing out the poor community, and just calling it their own.\u201d With South Central, \u201cRebranding is a marketing strategy on their part,\u201d she said.David Wex, a partner with Urban Capital, said the area under development has been barren for years \u2013 something protesters say is a harsh blow to the neighbourhood \u2013 and they are trying to give the area a name.\u201cOur intention was to give it a brand of its own,\u201d he said, which he described as \u201ccool, vibrant, and fun.\u201dWex said he is not sure how they are pushing out the poor. They are taking over, not homes, but parking lots to build their condos.Karolina Craig of Urban Capital said she pitched local businesses the idea and they were generally in favour of the (re)branding. It\u2019s free advertising, she said. Plus, phase one of the complex is already filled with tenants and the company has racked up plenty of sales for the other phases. More people are coming into Centretown and discovering nearby businesses \u2013 something that was very attractive to the local BIA.Some local businesses along Bank Street have put up stickers on their windows supporting the name change \u2013 or have at least let the developer slap them on their storefronts.The South Central Ottawa website \u2013 an attempt at a hip marketing campaign \u2013 even profiles some local businesses, but not all support the rebranding.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit pretentious and it\u2019s not really something that defines Centretown,\u201d said Briana Faubert, manager of the Herb & Spice Shop, in an interview. The condo company, she said, is trying to give the neighbourhood a fancier twist, taking away the identity \u2013 or the brand \u2013 the community has developed. The Centretown brand is one of diversity, she said, meaning the new \u201cSouth Central\u201d logo just doesn\u2019t fit.But Faubert is not against the raising of low-rise condos in her neighbourhood. Local businesses will see an influx of new customers, she said, but still, the condos are targeted toward the wealthy so small businesses geared toward \u201calternative lifestyles\u201d might not thrive.The Bank Street BIA has since dropped its support for the South Central brand.Wex said Urban Capital will survey local businesses a second time, again asking if they support the brand. If they don\u2019t like it, the company will drop it. But it\u2019s a matter of finding out if there is a genuine community-wide disagreement or if there is just a very vocal minority who oppose it. \u201cIt was meant to be a community bonding thing,\u201d he said, \u201cNot a community division thing.\u201dOne protester crashed the party, insulted the \u201cyuppie\u201d guests, and was quickly detained by police.Another Toronto firm is looking to rebrand the neighbourhood. Lamb Development\u2019s condo tower is slated for completion in 2015. They want to rename the surrounding area after the complex \u2013 South on Bank, or SoBa, for short. But James Street Pub is outside SoBa\u2019s boundaries, so if someone asks you where to find it, you still have two choices.",

Tardiness and and House of Payne\u2019s \u201cJump Around\u201d seemed to be the three constants at Bluesfest on Tuesday night. The first two didn\u2019t deter the massive crowd from waiting for the festival\u2019s most highly anticipated acts, Lauryn Hill and Snoop Dogg. The latter was included in just about every set.\r\rThe main lineup on Tuesday was pretty much groomed for Ottawa hip hop fans, as joining the two legendary performers was the young A$AP Rocky. The 23-year-old rapper from Harlem performed on the main stage before Snoop Dogg, and was accompanied by his DJ and hype man. Rocky\u2019s songs are slower than most of his peers as it\u2019s all about the flow rather than speed, hyping his young crowd up.With little bodies to compete with, it was up to Rocky to occupy the large stage. While he bounced from one end to the other with energy only someone in their twenties could have, it wasn\u2019t enough. The vastness of the main stage seemed to envelope him. His young fans didn\u2019t mind as all eyes were on him, and became even more excited when the rapper invited some fans to join him on stage for the last couple of songs. They went wild as Rocky performed \u201cPeso.\u201d His set only lasted an hour, probably knowing that most people would want to leave for Lauryn Hill at the Claridge stage.Those who came early to get a good spot had to wait a little longer as Hill started about 40 minutes later than scheduled. In the meantime, a DJ and a drummer entertained her waiting fans. It was crushing when they played tracks with Hill\u2019s voice only to be disappointed when she didn\u2019t come out. When she finally made it to the stage, Hill seemed distracted. She rushed through a number of songs (including \u201cKilling Me Softly\u201d and \u201cEverything is Everything\u201d), clutching onto a towel the whole time. Her voice was also muffled and difficult to hear her over the band. It didn\u2019t seem to matter to most of the crowd who appeared to be happy to be in the presence of the former Fugees member. Others however (myself included), opted to leave a little early and wait it out at the main stage for Snoop Dogg. Snoop\u2019s performance was pushed back a half hour from his 9:30 start time to accommodate Hill\u2019s tardiness. During the down time, a couple of fights broke out in the crowd and a few people passed out. Tensions and the temperature appeared to be running high as everyone tried to maneuver their way to the front. There were approximately 25,000 people in attendance, leaving little personal space for anyone.Fortunately, Snoop was the consummate performer as his persona filled the stage the moment he stepped on it. He did just about every top 40 song of his, including favourites such as \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d \u201cGin and Juice,\u201d and even Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d (in which he made an appearance). His show could hardly be called a family-friendly affair as the air smelled of marijuana (with Snoop smoking his own joint on stage), and his back-up dancers gave the west coast rapper lap dances.The hip hop then continued into Wednesday, though it was obvious it was losing steam quickly. Big Boi, one half the Atlanta-based rap group OutKast, performed for only a fraction of the crowd Hill and Snoop commanded the night before. He blazed through songs from both old OutKast records (including \u201cMs. Jackson,\u201d \u201cThe Way You Move,\u201d and \u201cBombs Over Baghdad\u201d) and his own solo effort. From the performance, it was obvious what Big Boi brings to OutKast as he spat out lyrics in quick succession.From the two days, it was obvious that it was all about Snoop Dogg. His audience ate up every second of performance. He owned the stage, the crowd, and the night. ",

City of Ottawa officials say that the study is not a correct representation of the city\u2019s traffic situation. They would need to learn more about the quality of the data and when the congestion was measured. Kanata North Coun. Marianne Wilkinson, chair of the transportation committee, says that the study used photographs to determine congestion rates, making it less accurate.She says the study may have been looking at a specific day of the year when traffic is usually worse than normal. \u201cMaybe they were looking at a day we had a snowstorm,\u201d she says, \u201cor when there was an accident.\u201dWilkinson points out that when there are accidents in the city, the roads are closed. \u201cAnd at that point, you do have traffic because there is limited access.\u201d Officials say that some of the most congested roads in Ottawa are portions of Bronson Avenue, Wellington Street, Carling Avenue, and Hunt Club Road, adding that congestion in the downtown area is dependent on conditions on the Queensway. \u201cIn the morning rush hour, I don\u2019t find it too terrible,\u201d says Wilkinson of traffic in the Centretown area. She says she often takes the bus to work from Kanata to avoid traffic. And if she needs to get somewhere downtown, \u201cI walk,\u201d she says.Using public transit, riding bikes, and walking are all alternatives to driving \u2013 and that helps reduce traffic.\u201cThere is traffic in the city, we know that,\u201d she says, adding that the city is encouraging people to get out of their cars. Officials say that the city is working hard to improve public transit, encourage walking and cycling, and improve roadways. \u201cWe\u2019re putting in bike lanes, so the number of driving lanes has been reduced downtown. People get out of their cars onto their bicycles,\u201d says Wilkinson. The point is to \u201chave people move from being in a car, to being on a bus or being on a bicycle.\u201dThe city is investing billions of dollars to expand public transit, cycling network and pedestrian links.

Back-and-forth identity swaps, broad musical numbers, grotesque masks, and rat-a-tat satirical dialogue are all part of Odyssey Theatre\u2019s production of Marivaux\u2019s The Game of Love and Chance \u2013 which is set to debut in Strathcona Park next week. \r\r\u201cThe funny thing is, it\u2019s not done very often. It\u2019s a bit of an obscure play,\u201d says first-time Odyssey director Andy Massingham. \u201cAnd then, in the last year, it\u2019s been produced three times. So, it\u2019s gone through a very strange mini-revival of sorts.\u201dThe Parisian-set romantic comedy finds chic young lovers Silvia and Dorante, who have never met, trading places with their servants to find out a little more about their suitors undercover, while the help take on the identities of their masters. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly constructed comedy. It\u2019s like Shakespeare,\u201d says Massingham. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely on-the-money structurally as a comedy.\u201dFor Odyssey\u2019s Strathcona Park production, Massingham adapted Marivaux\u2019s play for an outdoor venue. \u201cWe have the open sky, we\u2019ve got sirens, we\u2019ve got groundhogs under the stage,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we also have the benefit of being able to reach an audience in a way that indoor theatre doesn\u2019t allow. They can be bold, they can be presentational, they can also be intimate with it.\u201dMarivaux\u2019s original version is set in 1730, but Massingham changed the time period to the 1890s. The switch of time period allowed him to mix some iconic music into a story of the dysfunctional love lives of French aristocrats. At the curtain call, the entire cast performs the Can-Can.The more contemporary twist also allowed Massingham to strengthen Marivaux\u2019s already liberated Silvia. \u201cI want to really sharpen her up to like a modern woman,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that there also will be contemporary relevance because people will see themselves in all these characters as well.\u201dOne scene finds Silvia and her loyal but animated servant Lisette offering a satirical take on arranged marriage \u2013 something that Massingham says was rebellious of the freethinking Marivaux. In another scene, Dorante gives his peppy chauffeur Arlequino a good talk about taking over the role of his high-society employer \u2013 but don\u2019t think the oddball servant will master the part.Odyssey\u2019s The Game of Love and Chance will run from July 26 to Aug. 26 in Strathcona Park.

Every year, our city unites in a massive celebration of our country and everything that makes us Canadian.\u00a0We are a government town typically conservative in nature except on July 1\u00a0when streets are closed to vehicular traffic and the music doesn\u2019t stop until the sun rises the following day.\r\rMonths before the day approaches, the office of the chief of police sends out a memo to all officers letting them know they are working Canada Day. No excuses. We will need every officer we can get on this day!For the most part, Canada Day is a great celebration and an opportunity to show off some national pride. But some participants take it too far, some cannot control their alcohol intake, and some simply enjoy causing grief for others.\u00a0So we ask that our police officers take nothing for granted and stay safe while ensuring the safety of everyone else.Most Ottawa residents begin their day by finding the right red and white outfit, something that can withstand the rigorous rituals of this type of celebration. They look for a perfect combination of clothing that is breathable in hot summer weather but flows enough to dance and enjoy a meal on one of our many downtown patios.There are certainly fewer clothing options available to police officers who are required to look like a walking yellow pylon, easily seen in large crowds.\u00a0Extra radios are brought in from neighbouring police agencies and a command centre is set up reminiscent of something from Star Trek with all the technology available today.Emergency plans are checked and double-checked before the first morning briefing of our emergency response units. Officers and emergency personnel are bused in to keep downtown available to pedestrians. Several ambulances are strategically placed and arrest transportation vehicles are mobile in closed off areas.RCMP officers have secured\u00a0The Hill\u00a0in preparation for the first families who make their way to Parliament Hill to enjoy the morning concert.\u00a0On the other side of the river, Gatineau police and their partners have secured the water and bridges that connect our core to Quebec.The Canadian military conducts one final check of their equipment as Prime Minister Stephen Harper arrives. Our downtown command centre is now in full swing, ensuring the safety of well over 100,000 guests attending one of four different celebration locations: downtown, Petrie Island, Kanata, and Barhaven.Our police officers go through a mix of emotions throughout Canada Day depending on what they come across. I began my afternoon shift with a photograph alongside a young boy on Wellington Street followed by a knife fight between two individuals who had too much to drink.Alcohol interdiction is the key to ensuring overall safety because the more alcohol we stop people from drinking in the early hours, the fewer problems we\u2019ll have to deal with as the night progresses.By 10:00 p.m., an estimated 90,000 people have made their way to Parliament Hill to watch the fireworks and thousands more flood onto the streets to catch a glimpse. It\u2019s a beautiful moment as couples, friends, and families are reminded of how truly fortunate we are in the nation\u2019s capital.Long after the fireworks have ended and all the bars have closed, the last police officer leaves our command centre at 5:00 a.m., just in time to see the cleaning trucks take to the streets and maybe enjoy the sun rising during the drive home\u2026Planning for this event takes a full year but it wasn\u2019t until I became an officer that I appreciated the overwhelming pressures associated with it. I\u2019m proud of the work that everyone does to put this show on year after year for all of our families to enjoy. I\u2019m proud of my officers who ask their families to spend Canada Day without them so that they may spend the day with you.",

    "body": "\u201cWhy do we fall?\u201d Seven years ago, in Batman Begins, a young Bruce Wayne was posed that question by his father. The answer: so that we learn to pick ourselves up again.\r\rIn The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher Nolan\u2019s blockbuster trilogy closer, Batman has fallen farther than ever before. Having taken the blame for a series of murders committed by one-time District Attorney Harvey Dent in order to preserve that man\u2019s untarnished legacy, Batman is a wanted fugitive; in his absence, Gotham City has rid itself of organized crime with the oft-mentioned Dent Act.The Dark Knight RisesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard, Matthew Modine  But a new and exceptional threat rears its head in the form of Bane (Tom Hardy), a muscular escaped convict with links to Ra\u2019s al Ghul\u2019s (Liam Neeson) League of Shadows and aspirations of mass terrorism who pulls double-duty as both the pseudo-philosophical arch-villain and his own physically unstoppable \u201chenchman number one.\u201dDrawn out of retirement by Bane\u2019s violence, Batman tracks him down. But in their first encounter \u2013 an effective, brutal scene \u2013 it is Batman who is vanquished, broken, and imprisoned. Consequently, he has a very long way to rise.Whether the film awes with its relentless bleakness and pristine cinematography or stupefies with conspicuous plot issues and mounting inconsistencies is largely dependent on the degree to which the viewer is invested in this universe. Nearly $1.5 billion in Nolan Batman ticket sales to date suggest there will be a lot of happy moviegoers.However, once Batman reaches his lowest point, shortly after facing off with Bane, his rise is at once too long, too direct, and too predictable. Beaten and imprisoned, he has nowhere to go but up, and during an extended interlude that witnesses a seismic upheaval in Gotham in his absence, the plot relies on intrigue as much as on tension for propulsion.Even while tapping into some extended Batman mythology that circles back to Batman Begins \u2013 which is more relevant as a refresher course than The Dark Knight \u2013 Nolan delivers what every blockbuster promises: spectacle with emotional heft.The spectacle, indeed, is bigger than ever before, with legions of convicts and cops brawling in Gotham\u2019s streets, new vehicular toys for our heroes, and a looming nuclear threat. But in emotional terms, there is nothing to match Rachel Dawes\u2019 death or even the murder of Bruce Wayne\u2019s parents, though Alfred (Michael Caine), who as the Wayne butler has been the trilogy\u2019s sentimental anchor, soldiers dutifully on in the moral compass sense, supplying waterworks as required.Back-stories for no fewer than three new characters \u2013 cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), Wayne Enterprises executive Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), and rookie hero cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) \u2013 still fail to provide much resonance in the way of human attachment and loss. And with Hardy and Caine joined by Gordon-Levitt and Cotillard, it begins to feel like an Inception reunion.Despite succeeding in giving a general sense that things have reached a much lower point for society than they ever did in The Dark Knight at the hands of the Joker \u2013 a football stadium is partially demolished in the middle of a game and Gotham\u2019s entire police force is largely neutralized by Bane, whose intentions grow more incomprehensible with each unnecessary soliloquy \u2013 The Dark Knight Rises never generates the horror that came with seeing judges and police commissioners killed in broad daylight at the hands of the Joker.It was far scarier to behold the establishment intact and powerless than it is to see it completely absent while Nolan muddles about with the politics of depicting a bloodthirsty mob sentencing rich people for their privilege: the choice is between exile, which means death on an icy river, or death, which turns out to be death by exile.Even seemingly extraneous characters tend to matter by the time all chips are down, but the ones enacting blunt, painfully obvious character arcs \u2013 such as Matthew Modine\u2019s cowardly deputy commissioner \u2013 contribute to the feeling that there was more fat to be trimmed from this 165-minute adventure.For Nolan, \u201cbringing things full circle\u201d seems to mean rehashing a lot of League of Shadows platitudes from the first movie that never completely made sense to begin with.If The Dark Knight aspired bleakly in the direction of Michael Mann\u2019s Heat and similar crime dramas, sensibly doing away with most of the cartoon mythology in the process, here Nolan returns largely to the comic-book tone and universe of Batman Begins and modulates the tone accordingly, allowing for sporadic moments of levity in the form of banter between Batman and Selina Kyle or Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who, as ever, has a few tricks up his sleeve when Batman and Gotham need it most.Even if The Dark Knight has not aged perfectly, it remains the standard against which summer event movies are now judged. The impossible level of expectation for The Dark Knight Rises is precisely that, but it was unavoidable. Nolan was the one who raised the bar so high that now even he finds it beyond reach.",

Two very different soccer teams met up at Gloucester\u2019s Louis Riel Dome Sunday afternoon with the purpose \u2013 or, more obviously, \u201cgoal\u201d \u2013 of having fun, but also building social ties for one of the teams \u2013 a street soccer squad of homeless players.\r\rOttawa Street Soccer is part of the national Street Soccer Canada, which uses the sport to engage and empower isolated people and those living in poverty. The Sunday micro-tournament saw the Ottawa chapter take to the field with soccer fans from the Ottawa Police Service. Four teams were pooled from Street Soccer and from the police, with each team facing off against one another throughout the afternoon games.\u201cIdeally, we just hope it\u2019s a place for them to have fun,\u201d said Ottawa Street Soccer founder Tatiana Rother. \u201cI mean, a lot of these people come from difficult backgrounds or are facing difficulties in their lives right now. It\u2019s sort of a chance for them to just forget about their problems and to just play the game.\u201dRother said the games seek to build social networks for the isolated, socially disadvantaged members. Ottawa Street Soccer always tries to get the community itself involved in the games. Ottawa police are a leading organization in the community. If a player comes across a police officer \u2013 one they have played with \u2013 on the street, it will hopefully be a friendly interaction \u2013 an interaction that may have turned out differently if not for the game.Dennis Comb has been playing with Ottawa Street Soccer for just over a year, after hearing about it at the Ottawa Mission. Now, he tries to make every game.\u201cWe have a team spirit. Some camaraderie gets built every time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just good to be involved in something healthy; instead of otherwise.\u201dLast year saw a big highlight for them, he said. When he was just a green member, the team made it to the Eastern National Championships in Toronto. At the Sunday game, there was the expected on-field arguing \u2013 and some four-letter words when one player suffered a shoulder injury \u2013 but Comb was right when he said the team has built up a good camaraderie.

Still, the group has signed on some dedicated members through word-of-mouth alone.One member of the Ottawa chapter may get a chance to play in a much bigger tournament this fall. Street Soccer Canada will handpick members from teams across the country to represent Canada at the 2012 Homeless World Cup in Mexico. Watch the video.\u00a0 ",

The voyage commemorates the bicentennial of the War of 1812, with the ship housing a floating exhibit.Capt. Roger Taylor said the ship offers visitors a nautical experience they can\u2019t get from just an everyday trip to the canal. \u201cYou can get a feel for what it was like that you can\u2019t get from just looking at the canal itself or from just reading books about it.\u201dConstructed in Burlington, Vt, the boat\u2019s design is based on the 19th century O.J. Walker and the General Butler, both of which sank off the Burlington breakwater. There were no existing design plans for modern builders to reference, so nautical archeologists had to dive down to the wrecks over several years to take photographs and measurements. \u201cBefore these wrecks were discovered in the 1980s,\u201d he said, \u201ceveryone had forgotten there was any such thing as a sailing canal boat.\u201dShips such as the Lois McClure used to be manned by families carrying cargo. The parents and their children would live in a small compartment near the bow, usually sleeping in close quarters. If a hand was hired, he would sleep in a bunk near the stern.

But police say law enforcement visibility and programs run by the centre will not be affected by the change of address.\r\rThe centre closed for three months last year and began the search for a new location after suffering through a series of floods. Still, it was the locale\u2019s high rent, says Insp. Uday Jaswal, that prompted police to find a less expensive place to deliver their programs. The current location is \u201ca fairly big space we\u2019re not using,\u201d he says.

And the Centretown area also benefits from foot and traffic patrol \u2013 all of which are involved in community engagement and crime prevention. The centre also delivers these programs online, racking up a number of hits.Back in 2004, a methadone clinic controversially opened next door to the centre, leading residents to believe that drug users and criminals would be drawn to the neighbourhood. But Dekker says the police centre\u2019s presence may have acted as a crime deterrent.Jaswal says police receive few calls for assistance at the clinic and adds there are many clinics across the city not located next to a police centre but they operate without issue on a regular basis.Michael Powell, president of the Dalhousie Community Association, says police presence won\u2019t necessarily plummet, but the police and the community have to work together to keep it at the level they\u2019ve been enjoying for years. The centre will be moving from a residential neighbourhood to the second floor of city hall \u2013 a business and administrative area, leading to concerns about visibility and access to services, says Dekker.The centre currently sits in a storefront, making it easily visible to anyone who wanders by, says Powell, but tucking it away in city hall makes it less visible to passers-by.\u00a0 \u201cYou really have to know there\u2019s a community police centre in city hall.\u201d But the current location sees very few walk-ins, says Jaswal, adding the city hall address may see more visitors as it is in a city service-centered area.Jaswal says police finally settled on city hall after an \u201cexhaustive\u201d search. \u201cThis looks like the first location that\u2019s really going to meet our needs,\u201d he says, and it may offer an improvement to service delivery.The centre is scheduled to re-open at city hall in early September.",

The 2012-2013 school year is about to begin and with it a set of new students and anxious parents who are trying to keep up with what their kids are doing. \r\rNot that long ago, only kids were anxious about what to expect when going back to school, but an increasing number of parents today are finding themselves overwhelmed by the number of issues they are unaware of.Teenaged students today are facing concerns that I never dealt with more than a decade ago. Cell phones, texting, sexting, and cyber bullying are some of the many issues that face our future generations. Without proper guidance and preparations our young people are forced to navigate through these challenging issues alone, which we all know can lead down some dark paths with little hope of return.Police are seeing an increasing number of teenagers sending racy photographs to one another and then using them as leverage when the relationship gets rocky. Much of the motivation to even send these images is due to stronger than usual emotions towards a particular relationship.Special attention should be directed to friendships during the early years of adolescence (12-15). My experience as a youth counsellor and education in psychology tells me that relationships during the earliest years of adolescence are more intense than any other friendship. These relationships are usually accompanied by strong emotions and can significantly influence the development of personality and social skills.It\u2019s important to note that the role of a parent should evolve as quickly as a child grows and successful parents are usually the ones that have already planned for their children\u2019s next stage of development. We may not be able to make decisions for them during conflicts, but we can certainly influence how they prepare for conflicts.This means educating yourself on the current issues that our kids are facing, preparing a plan of attack to deal with the situation, and having the confidence to talk about topics that may be quite uncomfortable to discuss within the parent-child relationship. If you already have an open communication type of relationship with your kids, than facing these issues together should be little more than maintenance.Remember, you\u2019re not alone! Use what\u2019s available out there to assist you. There are a number of public counsellors and places throughout our city with tons of resources for parents. Your local community health centres are a great place to start and our Community Police Centres (CPC) are always stocked with materials for families.Teachers and friends are excellent resources for monitoring the progress of your child outside of the home. Talking to a teacher or their friend can reveal valuable information that you were not aware of and can give you the edge when trying to navigate through trying times.If you have recognized that your child is already heading down the wrong path and don\u2019t know how to deal with it, the Ottawa Youth Services Bureau (ysb.on.ca) is a great place to start. With a variety of programs for both parents and youths, staff members at YSB are well trained to deal with a variety of problems. It can also assist in proactive programs such as employment and mental health maintenance.Most important, don\u2019t give up! Failing to address minor concerns today and lead to repairable problems down the road. Far too often, police are called to the scene of an uncontrollable youth who has been conditioned through years of poor decision making. ",

    "body": "Provided.Const. Khoa N. Hoang With our first baby set to arrive, I wanted to do something special for my wife. I wanted our final few weeks without screaming kids, sleepless nights and extra meal planning to be memorable. So five months ago while talking to friends, the idea came to me: a prego-tour that would allow us to visit friends and family while relaxing in the comfort of absolute silence one last time.\r\rFor three weeks in August, we travelled to Hawaii and California and watched Broadway shows in New York City. It was perfect in every way except for one thing that caught my attention throughout the entire trip.It appeared that gated communities are popular to an extent throughout the U.S. that is rarely seen here in Canada. Entire neighbourhoods are surrounded by physical barriers to separate the residents from everyone outside. These barriers were often too low to keep anyone out but acted as a reminder to everyone else that you don\u2019t belong.Many of the residents I spoke with enjoyed the sense of safety it provides. Still, studies into the crime rates of gated and regular communities show little difference in the number and types of crimes reported.\u00a0 When asked why gated residents felt safe, most replied that it\u2019s because they know who lives in the area and are therefore more likely to take action to protect the neighbourhood. But no one needs a gate and a security guard to feel a sense of belonging.No one ever spoke about financial wealth being a commonality among neighbours. But it appeared to me that these communities housed only residents of similar economic class and that the gates limited exposure to anyone outside the boundaries of social economics.So I started thinking what I would have become if gated communities were popular here in Ottawa. Could a poor Vietnamese refugee kid whose family had no money and lived in community housing strive to achieve what I have today? Probably not.My success both personally and professionally came from the role models and mentors that took the time to help influence my decision making. Downtown Ottawa in the 1980s and 1990s was a working class hub of cultural diversity; everyone knew each other and helped each other out. I was never treated differently or excluded from walking somewhere because I was poor.Canadians have always valued a common principle and a general belief that we are all equals. Our community leaders work very hard to ensure that everyone has a sense of belonging in our city or, in the words of Chief Charles Bordeleau, that everyone matters.But despite what your opinions are of gated communities, they are successful in accomplishing what some communities here still struggle to do: inspire a sense of belonging and inclusion. Healthy communities require work, and that means taking time to speak with someone even though you\u2019re too tired to do so. Or perhaps inviting neighbours over that you don\u2019t know that well.Most of my work in crime prevention reconfirms that healthy communities take the time to know one another, and that empowered residents who take ownership of where they live are more likely to protect one another. So before the autumn leaves turn colour and the snow starts falling, today\u2019s a good time to invest in your neighbours. A small investment of time today cannot only protect your families from potential threats but can also improve the quality of your community as a whole.",

Eleven of the 25\u00a0 high schools in the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board did not register any teams or individuals at all for fall sports by the Sept. 17 deadline.Lisgar has registered athletes in some areas of individual sports, such as golf, tennis and cross-country running. For the fall season, Lisgar usually offers team sports, such as junior and senior boys\u2019 soccer, girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 hockey, junior and senior girls\u2019 basketball, senior boys\u2019 volleyball, and boys\u2019 rugby. But due to the cutback in teacher volunteers, all of these teams have already been cancelled for the fall season after failing to meet the registration deadline. Concerned citizen John Savage underlined the negative effects that this will have on Grade 12 students who are in their last year of high school. \u201cIf this goes on for a year or two, for some kids this is going to cost them scholarships. Some kid\u2019s futures will be forever damaged by this,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery time there is some sort of labour dispute, the kids are held hostage. Is that fair?\u201dDue to their larger teaching staff, Glebe Collegiate was able to register athletes in most of the 14 categories of team and individual sports.Richard Deadman, a member of the Glebe School Council, says that despite the strike many students understand the teachers\u2019 difficult position. \u201cProbably more students and parents sympathize with the teachers since we have a connection with the teachers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to support our kids while also supporting our teachers, who many of us know personally.\u201dDan Maxwell, president of the Ottawa-Carleton branch of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers\u2019 Federation, says it\u2019s a tough time for both students and teachers. \u201cTeachers who have made decisions to not participate in voluntary activities are doing that on their own accord at this point;. that\u2019s a personal protest,\u201d he says. \u201cVolunteer activities, that\u2019s what they are: volunteer. If parents want to come and volunteer in schools, I commend them for doing that. But at this point in time, our members are not feeling compelled to offer volunteer services to the system.\u201dMardi de Kemp, a spokesperson for the Ottawa Catholic School Board, said the Catholic teachers\u2019 union settled with the Ministry of Education in early July. Schools in the local Catholic school board including Immaculata High School have not been affected by any work-to-rule stoppages or a lack of teacher volunteers.At an OCDSB trustee meeting on Sept. 18, board members heard from the public and examined ways in which the community could make up for the lack of teacher volunteers. At the meeting, Savage said that there are plenty of talented coaches in Ottawa who would be willing to donate their time. Debborah Evraire said she feels that the OCDSB hasn\u2019t encouraged the community in light of the cutbacks. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that the call out to the community has been loud enough,\u201d she said. \u201cLet us know what the obstacles are. It\u2019s OK to say to the community, \u2018We need your help.\u2019\u201dThe OCDSB\u2019s policy for volunteers states that the volunteer must be 22 years of age or older, have a current police check, and be certified in the area in which they hope to volunteer. In the case of coaching a team, volunteers must pass standards set by the National Capital Secondary School Athletic Association, the governing body for all registered high school sports in Ottawa. Community members can volunteer coaches as long as they have participated in a National Coaching Certification Program, attended a workshop about that particular sport, or had past experience as a player or coach.However, if a team were to be coached solely by a community volunteer, it could only participate in regular season games. If the team wanted to participate in the playoffs at an official NCSSAA tournament or compete at a provincial level, there must be a staff member of the school present at all times throughout the game. Though Lisgar hasn\u2019t registered any teams for the fall season, the winter and spring seasons are not yet out of reach if enough volunteers step up. But the complex regulations might be discouraging, Deadman says. \u201cSome parents I\u2019m sure would be willing to volunteer,\" he says. \"But my understanding is that [these] certifications will make it difficult to find suitable and willing volunteers for a number of the programs.\u201d",

The location was revealed earlier when a call went out to artists to participate in a competition to create the monument. \u201cThe purpose of the monument is paying tribute to the men and women, who were soldiers, who were First Nations, that all came together against this enemy,\u201d says Sylvie Tilden, a senior manager with the NCC. \u201cThis is really a great opportunity for any artist.\u201dAs part of the federal government\u2019s $28-million celebration of the bicentennial of the War of 1812, the NCC will spend $780,000 on the monument and a total of $2 million on the project.While Tilden describes the chosen location for the 1812 monument at Parliament Hill as \u201creally a key site,\u201d she would not comment on the process of finding a location for the Kandahar cenotaph. But according to the DND the white marble cenotaph with names of fallen Canadians is still in storage. When it was first announced the memorial was to be moved from Afghanistan to Ottawa, Defence Minister Peter MacKay stressed the importance of repatriating the cenotaph quickly. The new site for the memorial was to be announced in early 2012. One proposal suggested Dow\u2019s Lake as the future location. But according to Lieut. Greg Menzies, a DND spokesperson, Dow\u2019s Lake is only a proposal and the question remains unresolved.\u201cIt is not set in stone yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe location currently has not been chosen yet, but defence is pleased to be working very closely with the National Capital Commission to identify an appropriate site.\u201d Menzies was unable to explain why it has been easier to find a location for the 1812 memorial.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different project, so I can\u2019t speak of the location of that memorial,\u201d he says.But according to Steve Saideman, an expert on Afghanistan at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton University, finding a location for the Kandahar cenotaph may be a more complicated process because it concerns a current conflict with an uncertain outcome.\u201cI think Canadians are still confused about Kandahar. After years of civil war, Canadians are wondering what we are doing there,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in general Canadians have a sense of pride that when we were asked to participate, we stood up and performed better than most of the allies.\u201dThe 1812 monument will be unveiled on Parliament Hill in 2014. Menzies says he hopes a location for the Kandahar cenotaph will be identified in the coming months. ",

Ottawa\u2019s infrastructure may be old and deteriorating, but the vast majority is still in safe, useable condition, a new report says.\r\rAccording to the Canada Infrastructure Report Card, released\u00a0 earlier this month by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, Ottawa\u2019s infrastructure is mostly in good condition, considering much of the city\u2019s infrastructure is several decades old. Ottawa-specific data from the report card was compiled and released in a report, the Comprehensive Asset Management Program. That report outlined the current state of Ottawa infrastructure, including the state of Ottawa\u2019s drinking water, transit and transportation.While most of the city\u2019s infrastructure has been classified as in good or fair condition, much of it still needs to be replaced or repaired as part of regularly scheduled maintenance. The public and media outcry over the sink hole caused by a sewer pipe collapse under Highway 174, near Orleans, combined with the traffic snarls caused by construction throughout the city, however, left many wondering about the state of the rest of the city.David Lau, a structural engineering professor at Carleton University, explained why the city\u2019s infrastructure may seem to be in a state of crisis. He says that construction is always concentrated in the spring, summer, or fall.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a reflection of the infrastructure failing,\" he says. \"With the growth of population, with the growth of organization, with the growth of the city, many of the facilities are at the end of their capacity.\u201dMayor Jim Watson says part of the problem is that the vast distance Ottawa\u2019s infrastructure has to cover makes upkeep that much more expensive. \u201cObviously we\u2019re always going to be growing, but we need to have smart growth,\" he says. \"The farther out we go, the more expensive (infrastructure maintenance) is.\"Extreme failures like the 174 sink hole and water mains breaks last spring on Elgin Street and Merivale\u00a0 Road show the outcome of the gaps in the city's oversight before the CAMP infrastructure report was compiled. Bob Palomondon, an Ottawa public policy consultant, says the new information will help the city upgrade outdated infrastructure before it fails.\u201cIf it\u2019s well-maintained you\u2019re unlikely to get major occurrences like we had with the sink hole,\" he says. \"Things can break, but you don\u2019t want them breaking with regularity to a point where it\u2019s causing havoc for residents, and it\u2019s costing more to fix had it been repaired properly in the first place.\u201d The plan for maintaining and replacing aging infrastructure will be discussed at a municipal meeting on Oct. 2. Questions remain about how the city's infrastructure replacement will be funded.",

A proposed 45-storey condo tower in the southwest corner of Centretown \u2013 a high-rise that would be Ottawa\u2019s tallest building if approved \u2013 is \u201cinappropriate\u201d in scale and should be redesigned for no more than 30 floors, says Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes.\r\rThe planned \u201cClaridge Icon\u201d residential-retail development at 505 Preston St. would rise far above the proposed SoHo Italia condo project just across the street, which was originally planned to break the record for building height in Ottawa.Claridge Homes has submitted a zoning application to erect the 45-storey building at the northeast corner of Preston Street and Carling Avenue.Claridge vice-president Neil Malhotra says construction on the condominium tower, which would include some retail space on the lower floors, is expected to begin in late 2013 or early 2014 if the application is approved.Holmes says several concerns need to be addressed before construction can begin. \u201cI think 45 (storeys) is inappropriate,\u201d she states bluntly. \u201cIt will be seen from an enormous area and will really be far higher than the downtown.\u201dShe adds that the property is \u201ctoo small for the kind of height that is being requested.\u00a0 Certainly it\u2019s an appropriate place for height, but not for 45 storeys.\u00a0 Thirty storeys is as high as I think we should be going in that area.\u201d Some residents and business owners have also expressed reservations about the shadow such a building would cast on the neighbourhood \u2013 a concern that was also raised with the SoHo project.Dalhousie Community Association president Eric Darwin says the shadow would be less of a problem with the Claridge building because it\u2019s at the end of Preston Street. \u00a0\u201cSoHo Italia was the first one in,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re also a little bit further down the street, and one of the concerns is that people don\u2019t want to see the whole street lined with tall buildings.\u00a0 It makes a wind tunnel and it makes it dark and gusty. \u201cBut because the planned Claridge Icon \u201cis at the very end of the street,\u201d he says, \u201cI think it\u2019s more acceptable because it\u2019s there.\u201d Holmes echoes that view. \u201cI think its possible to have a win-win, if it can be a lower height and if we can be sure that it\u2019s a narrow tower that doesn\u2019t shade the immediate area for great lengths of time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt needs to be a needle to relate to the street, and I think it\u2019s possible to get all of that.\u201dDarwin notes that increased traffic along Preston Street from new residents will be an advantage for business owners in the area. A key issue for the Dalhousie Community Association will be the impact on the sidewalks along Carling Avenue.\u201cThis is the first of many buildings that will be going in this area, which are going to be dependent on the O-Train for people to get access,\u201d says Darwin. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t seen any effort from the city to identify whether you need wider sidewalks.\u201d",

    "body": "A planned footbridge over the O-Train track to Little Italy is moving a step closer after public consultations end.\r\rCity officials are working with groups in the community to conduct consultations at multiple events. A public consultation will be at the Plant Pool Recreation Centre on Sept. 29, says Robert Grimwood, senior project manager for sustainable transportation. Feedback can be given online on the project web page, available until Oct. 8. Consultations were also held in May and June.At a Civic Hospital Neighbourhood Association meeting, Shawn Doyle, from Dillon Consulting Ltd., said the Hickory Street-Adeline Street crossing will mostly serve the local community. The company will be reporting to the city\u2019s transportation committee in December.Kitchissippi Coun. Katherine Hobbs says the bridge is being built because of the planned condominiums in the area. On the east side of the O-Train track there are two confirmed developments on Preston Street. The west side has four confirmed developments, including the SoHo developments. The footbridge is one part of a community design plan focusing on accessibility for incoming residents. Design plan consultations for the footbridge are slated to be finalized within six months, other plans can take up to three years, Hobbs says.\u201cWe\u2019re taking quick looks at areas of intensification. We\u2019re rushing it because we\u2019re being beaten to the punch. The developers are building faster than we can handle,\u201d she says. The concern is that as sites are sold to developers and buildings are erected, it will negate any design plans that haven\u2019t been finalized and \u201cdecisions are going to be made for you,\u201d Hobbs says. Lori Mellor, executive director of the Preston Street BIA, says city officials approached area merchants to gauge concerns. \u201cThe bridge is a positive way to connect us to the community on the other side of the tracks.\"But the Hickory Street crossing is not eligible for the one-per-cent public art project, Mellor says. The city has a policy requiring one per cent construction budgets be used for an artistic installation, such as the marble obelisks along Preston Street.Eric Darwin, president of the Dalhousie Community Association, says city officials suggested a standard bridge design or a more costly, design-focused bridge. The association decided to prioritize functionality over design because of the short bridge length, and expected high volume of pedestrian and cyclist traffic.Cyclists and pedestrians were glued to the curb before, following paths designed for cars, Darwin says. \u201cThe Hickory overpass is an example of designing for pedestrians first and is a good direction for the city to be moving in.\u201dCommunity members at the CHNA meeting responded positively, but there were concerns about snow clearing on the bridge.Darwin says he is concerned that the bridge may not be wide enough for sidewalk plows to go through. On a pedestrian bridge nearby, snow is plowed from one end to another with a \u201cmound at the entrance.\u201dAt least two developers are funding the footbridge, Mastercraft Starwood Group and Domicile Developments Inc., Grimwood says. Additional contributions are expected as others complete the approval process.The bridge can accommodate any future widening of the O-Train trench to make twin tracks, Grimwood says. A study\u00a0 was done for the light rail transit system several years ago, and if the city decides to continue with the light rail project the Hickory bridge needs to accommodate an extra track.",

    "body": "What is and isn\u2019t art is one of the greatest philosophical debates in aesthetics. Art is subjective. Is it enough for something to be called \u201cart\u201d for the public to appreciate it? Would the general public appreciate an abstract concept that it doesn\u2019t understand? Not when public funds are used. \r\rWhen taxpayer money is used to fund any sort of project, the project must fulfill certain criteria. It must have purpose, must be cost-effective and it must last a long time. The city doesn\u2019t spend money on constructing a road that will only last a few months, for example. Why should public art be any different? Take the new piece of art that is commissioned by the NCC for the Teardrop Plaza. Where is the Teardrop Plaza, you may ask? It\u2019s a small platform at the end of Alexandra Bridge that overlooks the Ottawa River and Parliament Hill. On Sept. 22, the NCC unveiled a series of curved wooden walls at the Teardrop Plaza, where people can sit on the newly installed benches to enjoy the city\u2019s scenery. The problem with this installment, called the Jetee, is that it will only be functional from spring to fall and only for three years. After that, it will be removed and a new piece will be commissioned. This sounds awfully wasteful and an unnecessary expenditure, especially in a time when all levels of government strapped for funds. The city puts aside one per cent of its budget for new municipal spaces toward public art projects and installations. Such projects include the abstract sculptures in the new Barrhaven South Recreation Complex. The cost of the sculptures is an astounding $300,000. What are these sculptures of? \u201cA grid-like form of aluminum tubes and colourful pods suspended from the ceiling of the complex,\u201d says the city\u2019s website. The sculpture\u2019s purpose is to \u201cengage viewers in a dialogue with art and architecture while rephrasing a retro-futuristic aesthetic.\u201d Pictures of the sculptures show a series of grey tubes, menacingly suspended from the complex ceiling, caging in several colourful pods. If art is a reflection of reality in sometimes an abstract and visually engaging way, then the reality this sculpture represents is a grim one, belonging more in an art gallery where people go to be awed and reflect on art, than in a recreation complex. It\u2019s a waste of money to spend $300,000 on a project that serves little purpose in a recreation complex, that won\u2019t be understood by the vast majority of visitors and is not aesthetically fit for such an environment. On the other hand, some of the public art projects tdo serve a purpose, and fit within the atmosphere of the community. For example, a large star-shaped sculpture that will be built in Half Moon Bay Park. The city\u2019s art is what makes it vibrant, colourful and unique. We shouldn\u2019t stop funding it, but we also have various other priorities, including the city\u2019s infrastructure and the downtown library. The city can\u2019t afford to waste its limited resources on art projects that mean nothing to anybody. The city should choose what art to invest in in a more careful way, taking into consideration a more rigid cost-benefit analysis for public art in a given environment.",

    "body": "To the inexperienced eye, wildebeests and human beings may not seem to have a lot in common. I, however, feel like I have shared a similar challenge as these great creatures \u2013migrating to find a new home. Ottawa is a built-up city. It\u2019s full of businesses, hotels and homes, yet it seems the travelling herd have settled down more quickly than I have. \r\rThe largest number of new homes are being built in the urban areas of the city. Ottawa is seeing an increase in first-time buyers between the ages of 25 to 35 and 55 to 74 year olds who want to downsize, according to Canadian\u00a0 Mortgage and Housing Corporation analyst Sandra Perez Torres.This process of urbanization is forcing students, such as myself, as well as those just starting out, to fight over rented apartments and condos in the city. When the fight is over, you can be left with some mangy looking places, or creepy roommates. I did manage to find myself a little leaky mouldy basement bedroom not too far from the university, but other people have to go further afield to find a place to live. You don\u2019t have to go far though to look for people who have struggled to find good rented accommodation. While brewing my coffee in a local cafe, Ariane Gathelier, a French international student studying at the University of Ottawa, says that she had been looking for apartments for some time before settling in Vanier. She says she couldn\u2019t understand how some people could live in the apartments she saw, given the terrible conditions \u2013 a toilet bowl metres from the tenant and infestations of ants.I, too, had a hard time finding reasonable accommodation by the time I arrived in Ottawa. Classes had already started. Every other student seemed to be settled and happy, chatting away to new friends as I trudged by solemnly and disappointedly after viewing my latest flat. Some of them weren\u2019t too horrendous apart from the fact that you could hardly fit into the room. Others, such as the one with the lonely woman whose house was crawling with flies, were a lot worse. What really boils the blood is that while walking around the streets of downtown Ottawa, I have seen properties boarded up, for seemingly no reason apart from the fact that no one has done anything with them. In the area of King Edward and Rideau, for example, there's four large houses that have not been inhabited for four or five years, according to a local resident, even though they are owned by a property developer who\u2019s supposed to be making them in to apartments. It seems cruel that these houses are standing there, in the centre of town, ready to be fixed up and used, while so many younger people have to commute from apartments in places such as Vanier because there is nowhere closer to downtown to live.Compounding the problem is that housing developments in the city centre are often too expensive for those with lower incomes. In July, anti-poverty activists protested against new Centretown condominiums that they considered unaffordable for many residents. \u201cLuxury\u201d apartments replacing cheaper accommodation is a whack in the face to those with lower incomes. Everything seems to be getting bigger, but what is being forgotten is how much an average person can afford.New condominiums are not where it stops for Centretown. There is an attempt to rebrand\u00a0 the area as \u201cSouth Central.\u201d This looks like an encouragement for class branding, an attempt at attracting a certain \u201ctype\u201d of person.James Meades, co\u2013president of CUPE 4600 at Carleton University, is an anti-poverty activist who participated in the protest against new condos and for more affordable housing.\u201cStudents are one group of people (that) can be targeted specifically by the growing costs of housing. A thousand dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment is normal. Housing can take up to 60 per cent of a student\u2019s monthly income.\u201d It\u2019s what he calls the \u201cstudent problem.\u201dIt seems that these condominiums will be as unaffordable as the leafy suburban areas also out of reach for most students and young people. If affordable accommodation keeps getting ripped down and turned into luxury apartments, there will be less standard living space for the ordinary resident, not just the students.Without policy makers taking some initiative \u2013 creating below-market housing aimed directly at students \u2013 I suppose we\u2019ll just have to settle for the tiny room that smells of cheese.

    "body": "The recent claim that Carleton University\u2019s Iranian student club received financial assistance from an organization affiliated with the shuttered Iranian embassy should ring alarm bells. \r\rMaclean\u2019s magazine reported that Ehsan Mohammadi, president of Carleton\u2019s Iranian Cultural Association last year, wrote to an Iranian government official asking for financial assistance. Whether or not funding from the regime was received is unclear, but Maclean\u2019s also claimed that the club received about $1,600 from the Cultural Centre of Iran, which was affiliated with the embassy. Some concluded that this makes the Iranian club an \u201cextension\u201d of the Iranian embassy. That charge may be a stretch, but it does bring the issue of club funding to the fore. In this case, Mohammadi evidently tried to obtain funds through Iranian President Ahmadinejad\u2019s chief-of-staff. Such solicitation should be prohibited. Rules need to be implemented at Carleton University restricting clubs and societies from receiving funds from foreign governments. That rule should be vigorously enforced. It\u2019s easy to pick on Iran, given its appalling human rights record. However, the rule should apply across the board: there should be no receiving of funds by Carleton university clubs from foreign governments. Period. Carleton University and the Carleton University Students\u2019 Association should strive to champion human rights. Receiving money from an organization, government or otherwise, is to be associated with that organization, as well as its policies. Being linked with governments, whether it\u2019s Iran or Israel, or whoever else, is to be identified with its crimes and abuses. True, some countries respect human rights more than others, but all have made errors, and the majority continue to do so. It\u2019s better to avoid them all. Alex Golovko, Carleton University\u2019s student association president, says he supports the Iranian student club\u2019s actions. Granted, he wasn\u2019t the president when Mohammadi asked Tehran for money last year, but Golovko should raise the standards. Maclean\u2019s may have overstated things when it charged the Iranian club for being an entity that does Iran\u2019s bidding, but the very fact that Mohammadi had no problem in being identified with a foreign regime should be a cause for worry.Student clubs are not sprawling corporations with multiple sectors in different countries. They are relatively small operations that usually receive modest amounts of funding. It\u2019s not a terrible lot to ask that they be held to a certain standard. Of course, all university sectors should be held to a similar standard in terms of respecting human dignity. If getting Carleton to divest from Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems is a difficult task, then barring clubs from receiving government funding is definitely a more realistic starting point. ",

Nuit Blanche Ottawa was held last weekend and the city\u2019s public spaces have since been reverted to their original, less artistic, states. But some members of the art community are hoping that this is only the beginning of the all-night art affair.\r\rNuit Blanche Ottawa was held last weekend and the city\u2019s public spaces have since been reverted to their original, less artistic, states. But some members of the art community are hoping that this is only the beginning of the all-night art affair.On Saturday, the city was transformed by more than 100 temporary art projects varying from live performances, to visual, media and projection installations. Co-curator of NBO, Lainie Towell, attributes the night\u2019s success to the community\u2019s hard work and the high response to their open call for project submissions. \u00a0\u201cIt demonstrates that the Ottawa arts and cultural community is ready for a Nuit Blanche,\u201d she said, with hope the festival will become an annual city tradition as in Montreal and Toronto. Earlier this year, NBO received start up funding from the Trillium Foundation and a small grant from the City of Ottawa, but the event was lacking a big corporate sponsor.Despite community doubts and some minor setbacks local businesses, galleries and independent artists worked side by side and in some cases collaboratively, towards a greater goal \u2013 the theme \u2018La Vie Est Belle\u2019, \u2018Life is Beautiful\u2019. Towell said that not having a big corporate sponsor in NBO\u2019s first year has not been a bad thing. \u00a0\u201cI think that it\u2019s really exciting that we don\u2019t have a huge corporate sponsor, so you know it\u2019s really the artists and their creativity behind the event.\u201d A young woman singing France\u2019s national anthem from inside of a giant birthday cake, a \u201cbefore I die\u201d blackboard, a bus wearing a sweater and an artist sketching imagined nudes of fully clothed people are just a few of the bizarre sights that filled the Byward Martket and Hintonburg during the one night art extravaganza.However, \u201ca corporate sponsor will help accomplish bigger goals,\u201d Towell admitted, \u201cand hopefully that is the direction we are heading in.\u201dArtist, Julie LaPalme, who helped organize Lemonjellow Productions\u2019 eco-friendly, origami-like, pop-up gallery outside the Ottawa School of Art on Saturday, agreed, insisting that the community put in the work and that next year\u2019s organizers should be looking for a big corporate sponsor.\u201cAs long as the artists see that money and it doesn\u2019t go to just making it a bigger festival where all of the artists are still doing it for free, then yes it would be awesome,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u00a0The Ottawa School of Art acted as one of three hubs during NBO, housing a number of varying independent artists\u2019 projects both inside and outside of the building. The school\u2019s director, Jeff Stellick said that if NBO remains \u201csomething that brings people out and makes them more aware of the local cultural scene then that will be good.\u201d\u00a0 But he was less optimistic about the idea of a large corporate sponsor in the festival\u2019s future.\u201cIf it turns into sort of a big all night corporate sponsor festival, then that\u2019s something else, but we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d \u00a0Even though last weekend\u2019s sleepless night of arts and culture kept Ottawa up late, it seems Nuit Blanche Ottawa has left the community wanting more. \u00a0",

Organizers would doubtless be looking for one of the big banks, such as\u00a0 the RBC or Scotiabank, to pump cash and credit into the festival as they did in Montreal and Toronto. But the question on many lips is, what kind of strings get attached to that kind of paycheque, especially when you\u2019re talking about art? Organizers may be thinking about signing on the dotted line, but I\u2019m not.Okay, this may make it sound more nefarious and evil than it needs to be. Sponsorship from a big-name company does have its perks and ever since that first caveman was given an extra bite of bison for his work on the walls, the arts have always needed a patron. Whether it was the church, wealthy aristocrats or jaded philanthropists, every artist has always had a daddy, so to speak. Art for the sake of itself can exist, but when it comes to a city-wide festival of this size and influence, having a few extra coppers in your coinpurse can\u2019t hurt. Montreal got branded by the big boys some time ago, and the night still holds a high reputation and distinction as a premier example of the power of art over regular sleeping hours and general tidiness. But as with anything, it\u2019s not that Ottawa is out of the loop entirely, just a few steps behind other established Canadian art powerhouses. But since we\u2019re a few steps behind, we can actively decide whether to follow footprints or avoid those massive, gaping holes that seem to exist everywhere, but go unnoticed until someone falls in one, or a few. Instead of sticking their hands out and getting a big Coca-Cola logo stamped on their forehead in exchange for some spare change, organizers should try getting the community more involved in the project. Nuit Blanche translates roughly to \u201cAll-Nighter\u201d so think of getting OCTranspo to run buses all night, or at least hourly shuttle services across the city. Turn local businesses into galleries, bus shelters into beer gardens or whatever lets you express your inner genius, but read the fine print before you start signing contracts from mystery men in black suits. Maybe it was small this year, but give it time, take what you\u2019ve done, learn from it and build on it. You\u2019re the art community for god\u2019s sake, don\u2019t pander to mass consumption and consumerism. Wait to stand upright before you start getting into bed with someone who might knock you over later. This is one of the few instances where I give you full license to be snooty, counter-cultural and generally dismissive of the capitalist economy. Hipsters, at your leisure. Whatever you do, just don\u2019t sell the soul away. Not yet at least, not until the price is right. ",

    "body": "John Kelly had been waiting for the chance to direct the show for years. \r\rWhen he first came to Canada from Ireland eight years ago, the rights to the Irish play Stones in His Pockets were available. But unable to find work as a director, he watched as the show was snatched up by professional theatre companies already thriving in Ottawa. So he decided to create his own company, and SevenThirty Productions was born.\u00a0Now directing multiple plays each season, Kelly finally got his wish when the rights became available again last winter. And when the show opened the season for The Gladstone theatre on Sept. 7, the comedy by Irish playwright Marie Jones carried a lot of personal meaning for Kelly. However, Kelly says choosing plays for the season isn\u2019t always so emotionally loaded. \u201cWhat you\u2019re trying to do every season is to build on the previous season\u2019s success. We don\u2019t have a whole new vision this season,\u201d he says. This year, four theatre companies will set out to entertain Ottawa theatre goers with a lineup of eight plays at 910 Gladstone Ave. While SevenThirty and Plosive Productions have been producing shows at the theatre for more than a year, this season welcomes two new players to The Gladstone. Black Sheep Theatre and Bear and Company are the beginning of what Kelly describes as an expansion that will be key to The Gladstone\u2019s success.\u201cIf a theatre is going to succeed, it can only succeed if it is part of a theatre community. And in order to do that, it has to become a venue that other theatre companies consider for themselves,\u201d Kelly says.Chris Ralph, The Gladstone\u2019s spokesman and a member of Plosive Productions, describes the vision for the theatre\u2019s future.\u201cThe idea is that The Gladstone would become the home for independent theatres in Ottawa,\u201d says Ralph. \u201cWe want to give as many different companies the opportunity to produce as possible. I\u2019m optimistic we\u2019ve found a niche for that size of theatre in Ottawa.\u201dFor Kelly, The Gladstone has given him the work he dreamed of eight years ago. \u201cThe Gladstone has given me the chance to continue with theatre.

With its debut season wrapping up Oct. 6, Little Italy\u2019s Il Mercato artisan market is looking ahead to greater success in 2013 after a summer of lessons in generating business. \r\rLori Mellor, executive director of the Preston Street BIA, said she would have liked to see more activity at the outdoor market, but understands this summer was just a learning curve.\u201cIt is so great artisans have honoured their commitments and they understand these things take time,\u201d Mellor said. Robin Duetta, manager of the market, says organizers started working on the operation in May, but by that time, most artisans had their seasons planned and booked. Although the number of vendors varied throughout the summer months, every Saturday a range of artisans came out to display their crafty skills. Sellers offered such items as handmade jewelry, unique art pieces or antiques. Barbara Martin, a handmade jewelry vendor, has been in the business for nine years and travels to various artisan shows throughout Ottawa. \u201cFrom what I understand, from all the construction, Preston Street merchants lost a lot of money,\u201d says Martin, referring to the area\u2019s recent infrastructure upgrade. \u201cSo what they\u2019re trying to do is promote the business back to Preston Street. This is why they\u2019re trying to get vendors to come here and do an artisan sale.\u201d Il Mercato was created when the Preston Street BIA was looking for new ideas to bring people to the district. The idea was to concentrate on the corner of Young and Preston streets and do something different from markets in other parts of Ottawa. Martin has participated in Il Mercato every Saturday since the event began in June, except for rainy days.\u201cThe sales aren\u2019t always great,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes you only get a handful of customers a day, but if you don\u2019t keep coming back, the people don\u2019t know we\u2019re here.\u201d Martin believes there was no lack of advertising for the event, so that wouldn\u2019t be a reason for the small number of buyers most weeks. \u00a0Duetta says there was a mix of marketing with posters, cards, word of mouth and the new social media tools available. Duetta explains that two things need to be achieved for success in an artisan market: a good mix of interesting vendors and a steady flow of customers.\u201cIf either is lacking, the other doesn\u2019t respond.\u201dAlthough it was a tough year for Il Mercato, Duetta said he has learned lessons and is in a better place to prepare for the coming year.\u201cMixing live music, theatre and involving the festival community will animate the spaces as well,\u201d Duetta says. \u201cVisual and performing arts have always had a complementary relationship that will be a key focus in moving the event forward.\u201dOn Saturday, Sept. 22, Il Mercato had a great day, despite the rain, said vendors. Key to the success was the La Vendemmia Grape Fest that was happening at the same time and brought many people to Preston Street.\u201cThere were hundreds of people out enjoying a pre-fall day,\u201d says Duetta. \u201cIt appeared that everyone had a great time.\u201dWith only two Saturdays left to display their skills this year, the participating artists said they were anxious to see what next year will bring.\u201cFor the first season of this market, we\u2019re very pleased to have some passionate artists who believe that Preston Street is the perfect place to have an event like this,\u201d says Duetta.

The concert has one main goal \u2013 to get young people to accept God in their lives, says Dylan Fox-Altherr, a leader with the Carleton Christian group Power to Change. But it will take more than a rock show to make church-goers out of the concert-goers, Fox-Altherr said. There has to be a personal touch if Rock the River is going to knock the average age of congregations down a few years.\u00a0\u201cI think the main reason people will go to church is because a friend invited them,\u201d Fox-Altherr says. \u201cIf they come alone, I\u2019m not sure how much they\u2019ll be interested in going (to church) on their own initiative.\u201dHe\u2019s volunteered as a councillor for Rock the River and will be there to help people who want to start going to church find one in their neighbourhood. Two potential recipients of Rock the River\u2019s evangelism are Centretown churches St. Theresa Roman Catholic Church and St. Luke\u2019s Anglican Church. Both have seen a rise in youth attendance, but for different reasons.When Rev.Vincent Pereira arrived at St. Theresa seven years ago, he says he expected a lot of Catholic students from the University of Ottawa. Instead, he found what he called \u201ca dead parish.\u201d The worship service was a spectator sport: the parish\u2019s hymn books were often missing and only the choir sang, backed by an organ. Now, there are violins and guitars, flutes and keyboards \u2013 mostly played by university-aged parishioners.\u201cThe people were at first critical, but now they are used to it and more inviting of young people in the church and choir,\u201d Pereira says. \u201cNow, it has come alive.\u201d It makes the churches more accessible to youth, says Fox-Altherr, when the worship service breaks away from the traditional choir-and-organ set-up.It isn\u2019t a strategy all churches are willing to adopt, however. Robert Jones has been leading worship at St. Luke\u2019s on a 75-year-old pipe organ for more than a decade and doesn\u2019t plan to swap it for an electric keyboard any time soon.\u201cIf I want rock music, I\u2019ll go to a rock concert or go to a bar,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI just don\u2019t find it helpful in church.\u201d His choir of 20 is hardly ancient, though, despite the traditional format and older hymns.St. Luke\u2019s has seen a lot more young people over the last few years, but not because it rocks and rolls. Instead, they rely on the advertising they do in the city. Granted, having a reverend who stands on the front steps every Sunday inviting passer-bys to join the service doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201c(Rev. Gregor Sneddon) made it very clear at the very beginning that we have a motto \u2013 everyone is welcome, without exception,\u201d says Jones. The organist says he doesn\u2019t doubt that Christian events such as\u00a0 Rock the River do help young people discover church, he just doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re vital. If people want to go, they will find a way, and they will find something that suits them. \u201cThey may come here and say, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s not for me,\u2019 and go to a different church,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey may end up at a rock church.\u201d But if they\u2019re going to end up anywhere, Fox-Altherr, Pereira, and Jones both agree on one thing: it\u2019ll take more than jamming to the gospel to get them there.

    "body": "Brielle Morgan, Centretown NewsJames Street Pub is seeing more empty chairs than usual because of the NHL lockout.  Downtown sports bars are bracing for the impact of what\u2019s expected to be an extended NHL lockout, which one Centretown pub owner says could reduce revenues by up to 25 per cent and force job cuts.\r\rThe Ottawa Senators and 29 other NHL clubs across North America are widely expected to be out of action until at least December in a dispute over revenue-sharing between players, league bosses and team owners.While the NHL lockout isn\u2019t expected to seriously affect the overall economy of the city, some Ottawa businesses that rely on hockey fans\u2019 spending \u2013 particularly pubs and sports stores that sell Senators paraphernalia \u2013 have said they expect to be hit hard by the cancellation or delayed start of the season.\u201cWe all look forward to the hockey season as viewers and as business operators,\u201d says Alex Munro, vice-president of business operations and development at Heart and Crown Irish Pubs, which owns the James Street Pub in Centretown. \u201cWithout it, we could see business levels down as much as 15 to 25 per cent.\u201dMunro said it\u2019s likely the lockout will force the James Street Pub, located at the corner of Bank and James streets, as well as the company\u2019s other locations to cut back staff. But the NHL dispute isn\u2019t likely to significantly affect the overall Ottawa economy unless general consumer spending is depressed, says Anthony Heyes, a professor of economics at the University of Ottawa. Businesses such as restaurants that appeal to NHL fans will be most affected, he notes. But he adds there is some possibility that other businesses could be affected if hockey fans come to feel an important part of their lives are missing, affecting their attitudes at work and decreasing the amount of money they spend.\u201cOttawa\u2019s a hockey city,\u201d says Hayes. \u201cFor a lot of city folk . . . a winter deprived of your passion is a long time, and a lot of people in the city will be hit by this \u2013 maybe not financially but emotionally.\u201dHowever, Heyes says there is no way of knowing for sure how the economy will be affected. It is possible hockey fans will spend more money on other attractions in the city, he says.Kristin McCartney, the bar manager at Don Cherry\u2019s Sports Grill on Rideau Street, says she is staying optimistic about the lockout and does not suspect a significant drop in business.McCartney says the sports grill will promote other sports such as football and soccer for their customers to watch. The sports grill will also offer specials on drinks during different games to attract hockey fans, including the estimated 100 regulars from nearby Centretown, adds McCartney.Heyes advises businesses that may be affected by the lockout to diversify and appeal to different crowds, just as Don Cherry\u2019s plans to do.\u201cMaybe this is the autumn to try to get fans behind the (Ontario Hockey League\u2019s Ottawa) 67\u2019s, or some other sport,\u201d he suggests. The trick to keeping hockey fans happy over this season is to show them something else to be interested in, says McCartney.But hockey fans might still feel depressed and stop spending, even with other things to do.\u201cJust as London is hoping for an economic boost from the \u2018feel good factor\u2019 brought on by the Olympics, Ottawa could be in for just the opposite,\u201d says Heyes.",

    "body": "At the end of the 2010-11 season, the NHL published a 1,500-word article on its very own website titled, \u201cBest-ever business year highlighted by record revenue.\u201d\r\rThe article touted the league\u2019s \u201cmyriad business records and milestones\u201d in 2011, including revenue of $2.9 billion.One year later, that has increased to $3.3 billion \u2013 making it six straight years the league has posted a record revenue. All is well, you would think. Yet, here we stand in the midst of another NHL lockout \u2013 the third straight work stoppage of Gary Bettman\u2019s term as league commissioner. And that\u2019s no coincidence. Just days before he and the owners officially \u201clocked out\u201d the players Sept. 15, Bettman told reporters \u201cnobody wants to make a deal more than I do.\u201dIt almost seemed believable. Almost. As Donald Fehr, executive director of the National Hockey League Players\u2019 Association, put it: \u201cA lockout is a choice.\u201dNot the players\u2019 choice. They were willing to start the 2012-13 season as per usual, even without a new collective bargaining agreement in place. It was Bettman\u2019s choice. Although most fans of the NHL can\u2019t stand the sight of him, Bettman\u2019s track record speaks for itself. He\u2019s the mastermind who got the NHL players\u2019 union to accept a salary cap in 2004-05 when they swore they never would. Under Bettman\u2019s watch, the NHL has come a long way \u2013 both on the ice and in the financial ledger. He\u2019s told us as much over the last several years. But don\u2019t be fooled. Bettman\u2019s a businessman. He doesn\u2019t care about the game. He cares about money \u2013 your money (and his $7.98-million salary).The players aren\u2019t innocent bystanders in all this either, but right now they\u2019re the lesser of two evils. Why should they be forced to accept any type of salary reduction when it\u2019s the owners who paid them all this money in the first place? Why did these very same owners dish out close to $200 million in salaries in the days leading up to the expiration of the current CBA if the system is as broken as they claim it is? It\u2019s tough to plead poverty with any sort of conviction after a spending spree like that. Keep in mind this is a system the owners designed (under Bettman\u2019s tutelage, of course). They should suffer the consequences of their actions, not the players, and not the fans. For Ottawa Senators fans, the lockout is a double-whammy. They\u2019re missing out on a team that showed its potential towards the end of last season and what will likely be the last they see of longtime captain Daniel Alfredsson. Has Alfredsson, who confirmed in late July he would return for the final year of his four-year contract, played his last NHL game?It\u2019s a possibility, but an unlikely one. Here\u2019s why: the Winter Classic \u2013 an outdoor game that has become a fixture of the NHL schedule in recent years. This year\u2019s game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Detroit Red Wings is scheduled for Jan. 1. More than 110,000 fans are expected to attend, which would set a new league, and possibly world, record. If there\u2019s a hard deadline to get a new deal done, there it is. There\u2019s no way the league will risk losing the exposure and revenue that single game brings in. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about money \u2013 at least in Bettman\u2019s eyes. If only the Winter Classic was around back in 2004-05 when Bettman and the owners locked out an entire season. This time around, the players say it\u2019s an \u201cNHL owners\u2019 lockout.\u201d They\u2019re probably right, but we wouldn\u2019t know because Bettman isn\u2019t allowing any of them to speak publicly.So, if you\u2019re looking for someone to blame, look no further. Bettman\u2019s the ringleader, he\u2019s running the show, and he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. This isn\u2019t an NHL lockout \u2013 it\u2019s his. ",

After seeing the Canadian Olympic women\u2019s soccer team win bronze at the London 2012 Olympic Games this summer and watching hometown heroes, the Ottawa Fury, win their first W-League championship in a near-perfect season, more and more local girls are taking to the pitch. \r\rAccording to Eastern Ontario District Soccer Association 15,000 girls will be playing soccer this year. Women\u2019s soccer has grown in popularity across the country in the past 10 years and Canada remains one of the few countries where the women\u2019s game is more prolific than the men\u2019s. There are few places in Canada that feel this more than Ottawa. The Canadian Soccer Association is hard at work in its Centretown offices organizing the upcoming 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup which will see games hosted in six Canadian cities, including Ottawa\u2019s Lansdowne Park. \u00a0With such success in the past year, it\u2019s clear these athletes are inspiring a new generation.\u201cWe need role models; that\u2019s what happened in the U.S. When the women found success in the World Cup, all the younger ones wanted to be like Mia Hamm,\u201d says Audra Sherman, the Ontario Soccer Association co-ordinator. \u201cI think girls need to look up and have role models, to see these women play and they see that they can actually play.\u201dOf the soccer-playing population in Ontario, almost 40 per cent of players are female, according to Sherman \u2013 a happy statistic for\u00a0 Ottawa Fury officials. \u201cYounger girls want to start playing and a big thing is we won the W-League championship which brought a lot to the city,\u201d says Jimmy Zito, the Ottawa Fury\u2019s development coach. \u201cThe rise in our attendance and our development programmes, we went from about 85-90 people last year, we\u2019re up to almost 200 now for this year. I think that\u2019s obviously because of the success Canada had.\u201dAs well as being fun and a good way for young girls to keep fit, playing soccer brings opportunities to young players that may not be open to them without it. Now entering its 10th season, more than 80 Ottawa Fury players have earned scholarships to NCAA universities in the United States and more than 100 have gone on to play college and university soccer in Canada. \u201cThe biggest goal for all the kids I get to work with, and the biggest goal we put on them is to get their schooling paid for,\u201d says Zito. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Canadian or American, get it all sorted, save your family that $100,000, or $30-40,000 whatever it is.\u201d The 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup will give younger players the opportunity to see world class female players from across the globe and watch a standard of play they might one day be a part of, says Ottawa Fury W-League head coach Dom Oliveri. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great event for Ottawa soccer, it gives female players here in Ottawa a chance to see world class soccer live and hopefully those players will, at some time, aspire to play at that level.\u201dWith development programs such as the one the one at Ottawa Fury and more money being invested by the Canadian Soccer Association there is every chance that the young players of today will become the nation\u2019s heroines of tomorrow.\u00a0\u201cSlowly, the sport is growing. Women\u2019s soccer is relatively new to the country and I think it\u2019ll just continue to grow and the more events you can bring specifically to Ottawa and to Canadian soccer the better it is for the younger players,\u201d says Oliveri.\u00a0\u201cThey can aspire to be those players, they can use them as role models. There\u2019s nothing like seeing a live game, live and in person.\u201d ",

Harvest season has begun for many growers, but a water shortage and other weird weather has led to reduced yields for some of those who sell their goods at the weekly Preston Farmers\u2019 Market in Little Italy. \r\rA mild winter, unexpected frosts, and an ongoing drought have helped make 2012 a tough year for farmers, says organic grower Kelly Butler, who manages the Preston Farmers\u2019 Market. Insects that are usually killed off by cold winters survived this year, causing problems for farmers, especially those who use organic methods, Butler says. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been battling the wather as well as the bugs,\u201d says Butler, who operates Helios Farm near Wakefield, Que. \u201cThis year we\u2019ve been most affected by flea beetle, cucumber beetle, and leaf-hopper,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re insects you\u2019d normally see, but we had them in tremendous numbers.\u201dMost prices won\u2019t change dramatically for consumers, but the impact of unusual weather patterns will be noticeable at community markets, says Brian Hamilton, who represents farmers in Ottawa, Arnprior, Lanark, and Renfrew for the Ontario Federation of Agriculture.\u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult to grow our local vegetables this year because there\u2019s no water, no rain to make them grow,\u201d says Hamilton. \u201cUnless the individual farmers managed to irrigate, it was very difficult to grow vegetables this year.\u201d He also noted that dry weather has prevented pastures and hayfields from growing, forcing farmers to feed their livestock with hay they would otherwise save for winter. Meanwhile, drought conditions across the Midwest states of the U.S. have contributed to high prices for hay and other grains. Wheat prices alone have increased by one-third since June, Hamilton says.The last time drought impacted such a wide area in the U.S. was in December 1956, according to data compiled by the U.S. National Climatic Data Centre. Meanwhile, the Ottawa region saw a period of extremely hot and dry weather this summer that broke records going back more than a century, according to Environment Canada. Hamilton expressed concern that these weather conditions could be part of a larger problem of global climate change.\u201cThis drought, or this change in weather patterns causes severe impacts,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cWhether or not it will remain to be long-term, we hope not, because it will definitely hurt us financially if it does.\u201d Unexpected frosts in April and an early spring also made this year difficult for fruit growers such as Chris Hall, who apple products at the Preston market.Apple trees normally blossom in late May, but unseasonably warm weather brought out the blossoms more than a month early, says Hall, who operates a farm in Brockville. But blossoms, which ultimately produce the fruit, can\u2019t withstand sub-zero temperatures. And a sudden series of frosts killed many of them off this year. Some farmers saw their entire crops decimated, Hall says. \u00a0\u201cA hundred years of farm, and a guy doesn\u2019t even have one bushel of apples,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s just unheard of.\u201d The drought this summer also stunted the growth of those apples that survived the cold snap, he says. The fruit can\u2019t fully grow without a healthy supply of water, Hall explained. The low yield has contributed to a 20-per-cent spike in prices, Hall says. But demand remains steady, since the one-on-one contact with shoppers allows him to explain the problems farmers are facing, he says. \u201cThe average consumer just wants a reasonable apple to feed their family and they understand that farming isn\u2019t a manufacturing process where every apple is 100-per-cent red, and 100-per-cent perfect size, and no bruises,\u201d Hall says. Ontario apple growers produced only one-quarter of their normal crop this year, he says. He estimates that his crop was reduced by 20 per cent. ",

Canada is in the midst of a labour shortage, and experts say that immigration is the only way out. The Canadian Experience Class - or CEC - provides a fast track for international students or temporary foreign workers in Canada who want to become permanent residents. I know this because on Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2012, I myself became a permanent resident through CEC. People like Gore and myself have worked hard and invested lots of money and time into being Canadian. It would be a waste to send us back with our Canadian degrees and work experience.If Canada wants to compete on the global stage, it must retain its expertise, not ship it away.I\u2019m glad Gore and I have immigrated to Canada. But we are the lucky ones.CEC has become the poster child for the minister\u2019s economic immigration reforms, which focus on recruiting highly skilled workers and weeding out the unskilled.Over the past few years, Kenney has introduced new language tests for skilled immigrants, cut refugee health services and all but abolished the Federal Skilled Worker program, which used to be the go-to immigration program for skilled workers. While immigrants who have Canadian degrees and work experience are welcomed to Canada, foreign-born parents and grandparents of landed Canadians are turned away. What Kenney fails to realize is that his litany of legislation discourages not only the undesirable, but also the deserving.Kenney says all skilled immigrants must take an objective language test to prove they speak English or French.I grew up speaking English, majored in English Literature and have worked in communications. Yet I still had to spend $294.95 to take the test and prove I speak English. I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to laugh or scream.Kenney says we don\u2019t need more parents and grandparents immigrating to Canada, mooching off of our increasingly strapped health care system. Going back home this summer, I felt pangs of guilt knowing that if my aging parents ever became ill, I would be too far away to take care of them. Immigration should not equal abandonment. If Canada wants to attract skilled workers, like myself, then it needs to make it possible for us to bring our families to this country.That\u2019s what Kenney doesn\u2019t get. He thinks he can draw a line in the sand and decide who is a \u201cgood\u201d immigrant and who is not. But unless the minister openly embraces immigration, he will lose the world\u2019s brightest to greener pastures.Kenney\u2019s get-tough approach sends the message that most immigrants are liars, illiterates and leeches on the state. His policies are anti-immigration at a time when Canada needs immigrants most.With a growing labour shortage, Canadian businesses need skilled immigrants to fill jobs. And homegrown businesses must compete globally to attract the best and the brightest away from their native countries.In order to do this, Kenney must rethink his immigration policy to not just tolerate, but welcome, immigrants to Canada.

About 40 old-fashioned automobiles pulled into parking spots along Sparks Street earlier this month as the downtown retail district hosted a Classic Cars Cruise Night fundraiser for charity that was also aimed at attracting weekend shoppers.\r\rThe event was part of a strategy to organize events on the mall that support good causes while livening up the street, says Sparks Street Mall event co-ordinator Christina Clark. This event in particular raised money for Prostate cancer awareness. Rows of colourful, immaculately restored vehicles, lined up between Elgin and Lyon streets, stood out on the grey, dreary day. Among them were an antique 1953 Nepean Township Police Cruiser and a bright blue 1960\u2019s Mustang. The People\u2019s Choice Winner of the night was an antique 1939 Ford Sedan, its motor on display for passers-by to see. Prostate Cancer volunteers were on hand to park cars and help with activities, in exchange for a donation to the foundation.\u201cThe PCCN Ottawa is grateful to receive money,\u201d says Wilfrid Gilchrist, chairman of the Prostate Network\u2019s Ottawa branch. The organization is volunteer-based, and primarily offers support for men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The Sparks Street fundraiser \u201chelps us with our program quite a bit,\u201d says Gilchrist.Although the car show was the first of its kind, this is far from being the mall\u2019s first attempt at combining outdoor events with philanthropy. The main focus, according to Clark, is to liven up the street and make Ottawa residents want to spend time in the downtown core, while promoting causes.\u201cSparks Street is really involved in the community, and we try to help as many of the charities as possible,\u201d says Clark.\u201cIt\u2019s really important,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe like the fact that our festivals tie in well with different charities, so we like to join forces with many charities to raise funds.\u201d Between noon on Sept. 13 and noon on Sept. 14, for example, for every \u201cLike\u201d on the Sparks Street Facebook page, one dollar was donated to the Ottawa Regional Cancer Foundation.Popular Sparks Street events, such as the annual summer Busker Festival, also combine animating activities with fundraising. Money raised during the Busker Festival goes towards supporting arts in Ottawa schools, Clark says. That festival, held in August, also drew large crowds, according to Janelle Lee, an employee with Sparks Street jewelry store True Bijoux.\u201cIt\u2019s a great event for locals and tourists to attend,\u201d says Lee. \u201cI think that it did bring more life to Sparks Street. The show that I saw was very interactive and loud and fun. People were laughing along and kids were taking part in the show.\u201dWhile the Busker Festival and the Chicken and Rib Cook Off (held in late June) are popular events with tourists, the historical street has also struggled at times to attract shoppers on weekends and in evenings after downtown office workers head home.The mall association has first-time initiatives in store for the future, says Clark.These include a Window Winter Wonderland that will see stores decorate their windows for the holiday season.

    "body": "Brad Clouthier, Centretown NewsThe site being considered for a new office complex at 801 Albert St. is currently a vacant lot.  The City of Ottawa has put pedestrians in a tight squeeze by approving plans for a two-tower office complex at a vacant lot on Albert Street, says the head of the Dalhousie Community Association.\r\rThe design, by architect Vincent Colizza, features 32- and 29-storey towers to be built on a triangular lot bordered by Albert Street, City Centre Avenue, and the Bayview O-Train station. The concern about pedestrian routes was raised because the office space can accommodate nearly 6,000 workers, but only has about 250 parking spots.\u201cThere are 250 people arriving by car and 5,600 are arriving by foot on a five-foot-wide sidewalk. What\u2019s the city worried about? The 250 in a car,\u201d says DCA president Eric Darwin.The planned development includes widening part of Albert Street outside of the complex to six lanes, but there are no plans to widen the sidewalks. There are still tools available for the municipality to get pedestrian access benefits, such as wider sidewalks, from the builder, but they need to be negotiated, says Darwin.\u201cIf a road improvement or traffic signal adjacent to a site is needed for people to get there, then the builder is required to do that. Suddenly for pedestrians getting there, the builder isn\u2019t expected to,\u201d says Darwin. \u201cThis seems to be a decision on the city\u2019s part that they\u2019re not going to chase pedestrian improvements as a requirement, and yet they are entitled to.\u201d The ability for pedestrians to continue to bike or walk in the area was considered by the developer, DCR Phoenix, according to an October 2009 traffic study submitted to the city.\u201cThe proposed development conforms to the City\u2019s TDM (Transportation Demand Management) principles including integration with existing infrastructure and providing landscaped pedestrian pathways on-site,\u201d the study stated. Ottawa council voted this week to approve DCR Phoenix\u2019s plan for the site.In addition to objections by community groups, Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes had raised questions about pedestrian access through the Albert Street complex. There is no guarantee an indoor passage will remain open after hours, despite efforts by Holmes to secure one.\u201cIt has been problematic in the past because owners can change and they change their minds. They may lock that door before 9 a.m. and after 5 p.m.,\u201d she said prior to council's vote on the issue. \u201cSo it\u2019s not nearly as advantageous as a walkway that is 24 hours and open to the public.\u201d Easy access through the building is a safety issue for pedestrians trying to reach the Bayview transit station, says Robert Dekker vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association. \u201cThis would be a concern to me,\u201d he says.",

    "body": "Thanks to a development boom in Ottawa, millions of dollars are waiting to be spent on St. Luke\u2019s Park in Centretown as well as other green spaces in the city.\r\rSt. Luke\u2019s Park and Jack Purcell Park, both near Elgin Street, have about $525,000 set aside for improvements, and the money is coming from an unexpected source \u2013 property developers. It might be difficult to imagine how new buildings of concrete and steel could make Jennifer Simm\u2019s trips to St. Luke\u2019s with her two-year-old daughter, which they take about four or five times per week, more enjoyable. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a great park,\u201d Simms says. \u201cIt\u2019s got different areas. It\u2019s enjoyable too. And I love the tennis courts.\u201dAt almost any time during the day there are youngsters on the playground, a pickup game of basketball or pairs out on the tennis court. But the park could use some improvements, say locals who joined Simms at Jack Purcell Recreation Centre one Wednesday evening. The 25 or so neighbours met to talk walking paths, fencing, park seating and basketball nets, providing input to Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes.Still, deciding exactly how the money will be spent takes some time. Consultations for improving St. Luke\u2019s and Jack Purcell parks began in 2007 and are just winding down now. \u201cWe have to go through a whole process of working with the public to determine what they want to see in their parks,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cIt does take time.\u201d Holmes adds that it usually takes about a year to work with communities and determine what parks need. Improvements for St. Luke\u2019s Park and Jack Purcell Park are being finalized now only because the city\u2019s development boom made money available.Under Ontario law, communities should benefit when property developers increase the density of neighbourhoods. To meet this requirement, developers whose projects increase density must contribute money to the city and a percentage of this money goes towards improving green spaces.There\u2019s also Ottawa\u2019s so-called \u201ccash-in-lieu of parkland\u201d fund that requires developers to set aside land for parks or give cash to the city instead. From these sources, Somerset Ward had nearly $2.5 million at the start of 2012. About half is going to upgrades at Primrose Park and Chaudiere Park in the west end of the ward. The remaining money, about $1 million, is allocated for McNabb Park, at Bronson and Gladstone. Holmes says the housing boom and the resulting funds, is particularly beneficial for Centretown. \u201cWe have the least amount of green spaces than any other ward,\u201d she says. \u201cWe certainly are short of children\u2019s playgrounds, so if we want to bring families downtown, we have to improve the quality and the number of our children\u2019s playgrounds.\u201dMcNabb Park community consultations, as well as construction at Primrose and Chaudiere parks, are all set to start this November. Construction in St. Luke\u2019s Park and Jack Purcell Park is expected to begin next spring. ",

Bank Street\u2019s castoffs could become Gladstone Avenue\u2019s treasure if a proposal to recycle old benches that are no longer being used is embraced by the city.\r\rThe Dalhousie Community Association suggested recycling the former Bank Street benches and installing them along Gladstone Avenue in a letter to Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes in early September. The benches are currently stored at a city-owned public works depot near Centretown. \u201cWe saw them sitting there at the storage yard,\u201d says Eric Darwin, president of the Dalhousie Community Association. \u201cI looked at it and I thought, those benches were in use up until last year and they don\u2019t wear out. They need repainting, but why don\u2019t we reuse them and why not let them go to some other neighbourhood?\u201dThe benches have been out of use since 2009, when Bank Street underwent its last streetscaping project and installed new street furniture. There are roughly 30 benches that can be restored, says Gerry LePage, executive director of the Bank Street BIA. After lobbying the city to install benches along Preston and Somerset streets, the Dalhousie Community Association says putting benches along Gladstone Avenue would be a natural next step. \u201cOne of the streets that comes to mind is Gladstone Avenue because there\u2019s no [business improvement area] and there\u2019s no program to put benches or improve the look and the feel of that street, but it sure could use it,\u201d says Darwin. LePage says the project is a good idea.\u201cAny time we can recycle something we do the environment a favour,\u201d says LePage.\u201cWhat\u2019s old to us is new to them and I think it works out well.\u201d Holmes says she received the letter and has forwarded Darwin\u2019s proposal to city staff for review.\u00a0 The staff's main concern is whether the cost to refurbish, install and maintain the benches can be included in this year\u2019s budget.City staff is also looking into alternative sources of funding to help offset the city\u2019s costs, she says. \u201cWhether there is any extra flexibility in the budget to take on these extra benches is the question. We\u2019ll see the budget at the end of October,\"says Holmes. \u00a0Darwin added the abandoned chrome benches are rusty and in need of cosmetic repair, but appear to be structurally sound. The cost of recycling the furniture should not be a major issue\u201cIf you\u2019ve already got the benches, it\u2019s just a matter of pouring a little square concrete pad on the backside of the sidewalk and plunking down a bench,\u201d says Darwin. \u201cHopefully (the city) won\u2019t come back with an opaque statement like, \u2018it\u2019s too expensive\u2019 or \u2018they\u2019re too old.\u2019\u201dThe repainting could provide a good opportunity for a community project, he adds. Holmes says she would support the project if it\u2019s sustainable. \u201cThe idea is great. Unfortunately it all takes money. Whether we have that money we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d says Holmes.Jeff Stewart, owner of Pressed, a sandwich bar on Gladstone Avenue, says he would like to see the project move forward.\u201cI think the businesses along here are changing as well so hopefully there will be more people and crowds spending time walking along here,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cI think that would support a longer term transformation to making Gladstone more of a pedestrian-friendly area.\u201dHe says concerns over loitering should not deter the community. He says people already hang out along Gladstone Avenue and the benches would help improve the atmosphere of the street. Despite the project\u2019s uncertain future, Darwin remains hopeful.

The library\u2019s main branch needs improvements to its electrical system, stairs, elevators and even its windows. While the building can be improved there\u2019s no room for significant expansion.During the most recent board meeting on Sept. 10 trustees voted on a motion to build a new library instead of pursuing renovations, but the motion was defeated by a vote of 5-7. Library board assistant Elaine Condos said the decision is not final. \u201cThey could have a discussion about it.\u201d The board will decide on the next steps of the renovation project during a board meeting scheduled for Nov. 19, said Danielle McDonald, the CEO of the library. \u201cAll we did so far was review the report. We will have a lot more to say in November,\u201d she said.On top of the repairs, the library will have to make some improvements related to the accessibility of the building as required by a recent provincial law.The cost of these improvements is still unknown and would have to be added to the bill, which is currently estimated at $6.2 million.Judy Bernstein, the director of an association for people with developmental disabilities in Ottawa, said the accessibility improvements won\u2019t be enough.

    "body": "Three out of four seriously ill children have vitamin D deficiencies, according to a new study by an Ottawa pediatrician, a finding that reinforces one Centretown physician\u2019s concerns about low levels in many patients. \r\rResearchers from the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario examined 300 patients from six hospitals, says Dayre McNally, the study\u2019s lead author. He says most of the children had severe infections or trauma. The sickest patients had the lowest vitamin D levels and took the longest to recover. \u201cThe children who were lower on admission needed more help from things like breathing tubes and medication to regulate their blood pressure,\u201d he says. McNally became interested in the subject during his residency in Saskatoon. He worked with a rheumatologist who studied children who suffered from unexplained joint pain. The doctors noticed these children tended to have low vitamin D levels, which led McNally to work on another study. It found children suffering from pneumonia\u00a0 lack vitamin D. He then moved to Ottawa and accepted a job at CHEO, where, he says, one of his colleagues was conducting a study on the hormone levels of sick children. The study was published in Pediatrics journal alongside an article on a study performed at the Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u00a0Vitamin D is absorbed by the skin when people get their needed supply through spring or summer sunlight and is responsible for proper bone growth. The body needs it to \u201cbalance the immune system,\u201d says microbiologist Jason Tetro, a member of the University of Ottawa\u2019s medical faculty. The vitamin can help the immune system fight off viruses and infections and \u201cif you have too little, there are going to be problems,\u201d he says. Most Canadians do not get enough vitamin D, says Dr. Megan Williams, a family physician at the Somerset West Community Health Centre. While a person needs only to stand in the sun for 15 minutes to get an adequate daily dose, she says there is too little sunlight during Ottawa\u2019s colder months. She recommends that her patients take a daily supplement throughout their lives, especially during pregnancy because \u201cthe amount in a prenatal vitamin is not enough for pregnant women.\u201d Expectant mothers should take 1,000 to 2,000 units \u2013 about double the recommended dose for an average person, she says. McNally says he intends to continue his research on how vitamin D affects sick children to see if seriously ill children recover more quickly when they are given a large dose of vitamin D. \u201cAll children, healthy or otherwise, need to take vitamin D. Compliance with this isn\u2019t very good, and that needs to change,\u201d he says.",

The city-funded agency recently presented a report to the community and protective services committee linking lower crime rates to special community-building initiatives in Vanier, Lowertown and the Pinecrest-Queenway area.In a series of pilot projects carried out since 2007, Crime Prevention Ottawa partnered with organizations in each community, including citizens\u2019 associations and health-care providers, to launch simple, community-based programs aimed at engaging young people and others in collective activities and reducing crime.\u201cIt\u2019s all about community engagement,\u201d says Stefan Cherry, liaison officer with Together for Vanier. \u201cIt\u2019s all about neighbours getting to know neighbours and the services that they can rely on.\u201dThe results presented this month to the community and protective services committee showed that the crime rates in the three communities have dropped significantly more than the city\u2019s overall rate. Pinecrest-Queensway, for example, has seen a 27-per-cent reduction in crime rates between 2006 and 2011. During the same period of time, Ottawa\u2019s overall crime rate has only been reduced by 15 per cent. \u201cIt is easy to see the buy-in and positive results from this program,\u201d Cherry says. \u201cI would absolutely encourage other neighbourhoods and communities to start similar initiatives.\u201dTogether for Vanier has organized a number of events to bring together the community and individual neighbourhoods, including \u201cMovies in the Park.\u201dThese free events were held in different parks throughout the community so residents could get to know one another while watching films, says Cherry. As a result, criminal activity in the parks decreased and families began to use them again. And Vanier\u2019s outdoor movie nights inspired a similar program in Lowertown.Vanier Caravan is an example of an educational resource for residents provided by Together for Vanier. Members of partner organizations go to different events and locations through the community sharing information on the program and different ways residents can get involved.Another educational initiative is the Neighbourhood Toolkit. This online resource is available to share ideas, information and resources from other communities.\u201cOur online toolkit is a great way for all neighbourhoods to get information and learn about crime prevention,\u201d Worsfold says. Crime Prevention Ottawa staff are available to come to community meetings to do in-person demonstrations of the Neighbourhood Toolkit, she says.\u201cWe are always looking into how to keep our community safe,\u201d Robert Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association. \u201cThough we have not started this type of initiative on our own, we are lucky to have had the Somerset Community Police Centre in our community.\u201dWhile the police centre had a storefront location on Somerset Street for years, it was recently relocated to an office at city hall, a move criticized by Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes.Worsfold has raised concerns in the past that Centretown\u2019s mix of residential and commercial buildings impedes \u201csocial cohesion,\u201d an important buffer against crime.\u201cCommunities that know each other, communities where there\u2019s social cohesion, are communities which are safer,\u201d she has previously told Centretown News.",

The museum has said it plans to create permanent parking on the west side and maximize its green space. However, the museum is on federal land, which means any changes to the property need to be approved by the National Capital Commission.Fred Gaspar, the commission\u2019s director of federal transportation coordination and federal approvals, responded by email, saying: \u201cThe current proposal (for more surface parking) doesn\u2019t reflect the approved Museum Master Plan for the site that includes green space and a long-term parking solution underground.\u201d Meg Beckel, the museum\u2019s president, says the commission is asking the museum to look for private developers to fund and build an underground parking garage. \u00a0However, attracting private developers is not so easy, she notes.\u201cBased on the parking traffic we get,\u201d she says, \u201cinvesting in underground parking at a cost of $10 million makes us unable to afford to pay off the loan over the prescribed period of time.\u201d She says the museum currently makes $650,000 each year on parking, adding, \u201cwe don\u2019t see the business case\u201d for an underground garage.However, Centretown resident Roshell Bissett says she was happy the NCC is asking the museum to look into underground parking. \"I\u2019m glad the NCC is standing by their commitment to green space and that hopefully we\u2019ll have something done to prevent the (surface) parking.\u201d Bissett says the museum\u2019s west side lawn is important to Centretown residents. \u201cThe museum is surrounded by condos, affordable housing and daycares, so there is a real need for a collective gathering space where people can take a break from the city.\u201dBissett says for 100 years the area was a heritage park, and an agreement had been made that after the museum\u2019s renovations finished in 2010, the museum would restore the park. Instead, she claims, the museum broke its promise when it created temporary parking instead. \u201cWe feel that\u2019s a betrayal,\u201d she says. However, Beckel says the museum is currently using less green space for parking than it has in the last 100 years. At the moment, the NCC has not made any final decisions about where to put the permanent parking garage. Gaspar says the NCC \u201chas had preliminary discussions with the museum to discuss the proposal, and we will continue to engage proactively with them\u00a0with regards to their short-term challenges.\u201d Bissett says the fact the NCC has asked the museum to look for private developers for the underground parking garage is a step forward in preventing the above ground parking garage.

The private member\u2019s bill would allow Ottawa and other Ontario municipalities involved in the red-light camera program to send tickets to drivers in another province or state. City council approved a measure to push the province to make these changes due to concerns over road safety and lost revenue, reports the Ottawa Citizen. More than $390,000 in fines was lost in 2011 because 1,500 red-light camera tickets could not be issued to vehicles from outside the province. The city is allowed access to plate information from other jurisdictions to enforce offences such as parking tickets. But legislation governing the red-light program won\u2019t allow the mailing of tickets to out-of-province offenders.\u201cThis is a road safety issue, and one of fairness,\u201d said Naqvi in a news release. \u201cIf someone runs a red light in our community, and is caught by a red light camera, they should be held responsible.\u201dIn the meantime, the city is looking into changes it could make on its own, according to the Citizen, if the province doesn\u2019t go forward with the bill.",

Diane Holmes, while voting for the motion, expressed concern over the potential costs such a facility will bring and what she says is the \u201cminute amount of money\u201d that will be re turned to the community. The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation gives a certain percentage of its revenue back to its casino\u2019s host communities. These funds go towards community supports, primarily through Local Health Integration Networks.\u201cThere is a gambling addiction in this city,\u201d Holmes said. And Ottawa needs more support from the OLG to deal with the public health costs of gaming facilities. Holmes added that she has reservations about the process. The gaming corporation can now put out a request for proposals and decide on the site of the casino. Council does not have the final say in what site will be approved. And while there are a few location ideas floating around \u2013 such as expanding the Rideau Carleton Raceway or building a gaming facility near Scotiabank Place \u2013 no one knows where the casino will be located, its size and its impacts on the community. \u201cWe\u2019re going on faith here,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cWe\u2019re going forward somewhat blinded.\u201dSupporters including Mayor Jim Watson say such a project would benefit the city through increased tourism, jobs and economic revenue, but members of the public and community organizations say they\u2019re wary of building a new gaming facility in Ottawa.Dallas Smith, an addictions counsellor at the Centretown Community Health Centre, says gambling addictions can be very serious for individuals and for their families.\u201cThe consequences of problem gambling are usually, unfortunately, very extreme. Part of it is people get caught up in the cycle of gambling. Losing and chasing their losses,\u201d Smith says. \u201cGoing back, hoping to regain everything that they\u2019ve lost.\u201d A new casino would not necessarily increase rates of addictions in the city, Smith says. This would ultimately depend on where the facility is built, how easy it is to get there and what sort of games are available. \u00a0But Smith notes that gambling has strong links to health problems. In his daily work, he sees clients with blood pressure issues, back pain, depression and anxiety \u2013 all linked to gambling. Not only that, Smith says, \u201csevere problem gamblers often get to the point where it becomes quite desperate\u201d and can turn to violence to get money.\u201cUsually when someone seeks help for problem gambling they\u2019re in a really critical state.\u201dGloucester-Southgate Coun. Diane Deans was one of the five city councillors to vote against the motion. Nineteen councillors voted in approval.\u201cThis was a major decision for our community and it should be an evidence-based decision,\u201d Deans says. Instead, she says, council is approving a motion without proper data or research about the effects of gaming facilities and what impact one would have on the city.\u201cI don\u2019t think that you make a decision first and then get the evidence later. That seems very backwards in terms of a process,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are definite links between the proximity of gambling facilities and the number of people who end up with gambling addictions. \u201cI just feel like this is a significant community decision and it should be made with all of the information and knowledge available to us.\u201dRobert Murray, from the Canadian Association for Mental Health\u2019s Problem Gambling Institute, says building gambling facilities is something communities need to take into careful consideration. \u201cWhen a casino opens, the population in the immediate environment of that casino oftentimes does end up gambling more,\u201d Murray says. \u201cAnd as the community thinks about this they need to consider not only the revenue generation and jobs, those positive things that come from the development of a new gambling facility, but also the fact that gambling is a risky behaviour.\u201d",

It is a huge eyesore, it\u2019s deteriorating, and yet it\u2019s a perfect spot of prime real estate in Centretown,\u201d he says. \u201cThe purpose of the petition is to give people an outlet to make their views known; that this situation is just really unacceptable.\u201dThe Somerset House saga started in November 2007 when part of the building collapsed during renovation work.\u00a0 The saga has been punctuated by lawsuits. The city first took the owner, Tony Shahrasebi, to court, and the owner then counter-sued the city. After five years of inactivity, the petition is demanding an end to the tale -- 234 people had signed the petition by Wednesday. The petition calls for the city and the owner to find a solution to the legal struggles surrounding the Somerset House and either develop a building along with the remaining facade or tear it down. Morrison says the first option is the better scenario, but also says there is no choice, if something new can\u2019t be build around the remaining facade. \u201cThe point of the petition is, it\u2019s better to have to tear it down and put something up, than for the walls to sit there for another five years,\u201d Morrison says.David Flemming, past-president of Heritage Ottawa who has followed the case from the beginning, disagrees the time has come to talk about tearing the Somerset House down.\u201cWe have a long way to go before that becomes the only solution,\u201d Flemming says. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want to see it demolished.\u201dFrom a heritage perspective, he says, the opportunity of keeping the facade would be ideal. He does, however, support the community sending the message to the city and the owner.\u201cIt is nice to see the community getting involved,\u201d says Flemming. \u201cA petition with 230 names on it going to city council would be more effective than an intervention by Heritage Ottawa. We certainly support that kind of advocacy \u2013 the advocacy that comes out of the community.\u201dAccording to Morrison, the petition is also about communicating frustration and he says both the city and the owner are \u201cholding the residents hostage\u201d by not keeping the community informed about the case.\u00a0\u201cThere has not been a lot of communication from either side,\u201d says Morrison. \u201cThat\u2019s another part of the community\u2019s frustration \u2013 we don\u2019t know where in the process we are at.\u201dNeither Somerset Coun.

The first thing visitors hear when they walk into the room is a monstrous popping and bubbling noise. Imagine Satan burping. \r\rThe first thing visitors hear when they walk into the room is a monstrous popping and bubbling noise. Imagine Satan burping. These are the sounds of the Earth, recorded at a station that measures subterranean vibrations and played at 10,000 times their actual speed. The Canadian Museum of Nature opened its new exhibit \u201cNature Unleashed\u201d last week. It puts a spotlight on the science behind natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes and hurricanes.The exhibit was borrowed from the Field Museum in Chicago, says Caroline Lanthier, one of the curators of the exhibit, but enhanced with Canadian content such as information about the 1998 ice storm that Centretown and much of Eastern Canada experienced. She says the exhibit offers scientific explanations for the causes of natural disasters, but also shows how communities are affected by them, by including testimonies from tornado survivors. This balance between the two is a \u201creal eye-opener,\u201d she says. Lanthier\u2019s adapted the American exhibit for a Canadian audience, hiring translators to convert the English text and audio into French. \u00a0The Ottawa curators added a list of this country\u2019s most famous disasters, such as the tornado that ravaged Edmonton in 1987 and the flood that forced 10,000 residents of Winnipeg to evacuate the city in 1950. A panel is devoted to the ice storm that paralyzed Ottawa for five days in January 1998.The storm left 1.5 million people without power for several days. Twenty-eight people died and more than 900 were injured from falling ice, hypothermia and carbon monoxide poisoning following the misuse of emergency generators. As people drive up O\u2019Connor Street to visit the museum they can see a car, flipped on its side and crushed by an uprooted tree, all on the museum\u2019s front lawn. This is an installment to generate excitement about the new exhibit.The first portion of the exhibit is dedicated to earthquakes. A television monitor shows a map of the world with colourful little dots to demonstrate where earthquakes are happening.There is a tiny yellow dot right over Ottawa because there was an earthquake last Tuesday, says Paula Piilonen, a mineralogist and a research representative for the exhibit. \u201cWe are in the St. Laurence rift so we get them on a regular basis, but we usually don\u2019t even notice,\u201d she says. Last week\u2019s earthquake registered 2.7 on the Richter scale, Piilonen says. Any seismic activity under 3.0 goes unnoticed. The next section of the exhibit is about volcanoes and displays artifacts such as magma from Mount Vesuvius, and a jar of ashes from Mount St. Helens, in Washington state.However, what really makes the exhibit special is its more \u201chands-on\u201d segments, Piilonen says. Madeleine Cole, a visitor from Iqaluit, took her three children to the exhibit. She said they all enjoyed the \u201cmake your own volcano\u201d activity, an interactive video where children use buttons to adjust the amount of gas and magma they want in their volcano. \u201cI also thought the hurricane part was really well done, she says. \u201cI thought the quotes they used from the survivors really added to it.\u201d Lanthier says one of her favourite sections of the exhibit was a series of testimonies from people who evacuated New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.\u201cWe had to hire actors to read the translated material, so I ended up listening to it over and over again,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very moving, it really grabs you.\u201d",

A group of canoeists is paddling 1,800 kilometres to Washington, D.C., from Centretown\u2019s Victoria Island in memory of Algonquin elder William Commanda and to raise awareness of river conservation.\r\rThe \u201cCapital to Capitol by Canoe\u201d expedition began in early September to promote water protection initiatives among Canadians and Americans. Commanda, who died in 2011 at age 97, was a well-known Algonquin elder committed to the environment and peace, says Capital to Capitol canoeist Connie Downes. Commanda wanted Victoria Island to become an international peace centre, she adds. Commanda\u2019s ancestors from across North America, including Potomac River in Washington, would meet at Victoria Island to discuss environmental concerns such as how all waterways are linked, says Romola Thumbadoo, a volunteer coordinator at Circle of Nations, a group dedicated to peace and environmental stewardship and founded by Commanda. Max Finkelstein, the organizer of the expedition, says the trip is meant to encourage people on both sides of the Canada-U.S border to keep waterways clean. \u201cWe\u2019re all connected to water,\u201d says Finkelstein. \u201cWater ecosystems transcend national boundaries.\u201dAbout 100 people attended the expedition\u2019s launch event at Victoria Island located on the Ottawa River behind the Parliament Buildings, says Finkelstein.Algonquin elder Evelyne Commanda performed a blessing ceremony for the expedition and the canoeists before they paddled away from the island. Finkelstein says that he was pleased Evelyne Commanda, the daughter of William Commanda, had honoured the trip.\u201cIt was an important start for this undertaking because we\u2019re doing this for Mother Earth,\u201d says Finkelstein. Former city councillor and Capital to Capitol canoeist Clive Doucet says life cannot continue without clean water and that cities such as Ottawa sometimes forget this. \u201cMax has been working with rivers and water quality all his life,\u201d says Doucet. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been working on urban sustainability, and it occurred to me that almost all cities live by rivers or waterways.\u201d Doucet says that much of the water in rural Ottawa is contaminated and that communities such as Russell must have water pumped in from 30 kilometres away. Finkelstein says residents in Centretown can make a difference in the health of the Ottawa River by being conscious of what they consume. \u201cEverything you put in yourself will end up in the water,\u201d says Finkelstein. \u201cAnd everything that\u2019s in the water will end up in you.\u201d The Canadian Wildlife Federation connected the canoeists to national historic sites and parks to stay at while the group completed the Canadian portion of the journey, says CWF communications director, Pam Logan. She says the federation also has an education initiative to encourage Canadians to follow the journey online. In late September and early October, the canoeists spent a few days in New York City discussing water conservation issues with different groups from that area.Capital to Capitol by Canoe hopes to be welcomed into Washington by mid-October.

The public outcry centred on the location of the office near Elgin Street Public School and Minto Park, site of a memorial to murdered women.\u201cSix or seven months later (after the parole office moved), without any consultation with the neighbourhood, Corrections Canada looked like they were slinking back into the office,\u201d Galpin says. \u201cWhy, again, all the secrecy, and why not tell the neighbourhood who is going in there?\u201dRecruitment posters don\u2019t necessarily mean that the parole office is re-establishing a presence, but Galpin has tried to get clarification from Corrections Canada, as well as local and federal politicians, with little success. Galpin says he was told by Corrections Canada that the site was being used for \u201cadministrative purposes.\u201d But he says that is so vague it could mean anything.In the meantime, Corrections Canada admits that the site is being used for staff recruitment purposes and that no parolees have attended the office since September 2009.\u201cIn order to ensure continued value for taxpayers, the Correctional Service of Canada decided to locate its recruitment team at (the Gilmour Street site) as this represents a cost efficiency for the organization,\u201d media relations officer Christa McGregor told Centretown News in an email. \u201cStaff from CSC\u2019s Human Resource Management team, which is part of CSC\u2019s National Headquarters, work at the site.\u201dAt Galpin\u2019s request, Ottawa Centre MP Paul Dewar tried to get in contact with Rona Ambrose, the minister of public works and government services. Her ministry acts as landlord for 301 Elgin St., but it took more than\u00a0 three weeks to get any sort of response.In an email to Galpin, Dewar\u2019s office told Galpin that Ambrose\u2019s office said that the former parole office was being used as a home for Correctional Services Administration Services (its human resources department), and it would remain in the building until Sept. 30, 2013, when the current lease expires.The only remaining question is why it took so much effort to get an explanation about the building's use from Corrections Canada or the ministry of public works and government services. Galpin says Corrections Canada should have been more up front about their human resources department moving to 301 Elgin Street, which could have avoided this confusion in the first place.",

    "body": "City council made the right decisionWednesday when it tentatively approved a decision\u00a0 to send a letter to the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission, expressing the city\u2019s interest in developing a casino. \r\rThe idea of a casino in Ottawa has the strong support of Mayor Jim Watson, many councillors and many community businesses and organizations. Others have voiced concerns that a casino will foster gambling addictions and lead to a host of other problems. So far, it appears that most Ottawa residents support the development of a casino in the city. According to an Ottawa Sun survey, 58 per cent of people who voted think the city should have a casino, even though no location has been identified. Why? Well, according to the survey, 51 per cent of people listed \u201cthe economic spinoff in terms of job creation\u201d as a main benefit, while 40 per cent said that it would be a financial bonanza for the city.While those numbers are not representative of all of Ottawa, they point out that a sizeable majority of voters want a casino in the city. The idea has also been received with enthusiasm from local businesses, because they see a casino as bringing in tourists.But it\u2019s not just businesses that would benefit. The reason Watson supports the development of a casino is because it would bring the city extra revenue that currently goes to the Casino du Lac-Leamy in Gatineau. It\u2019s no secret that the city is currently in need of major infrastructure projects and repairs or that it has less and less funds to maintain and update all its services. The added revenue that the casino would bring would lessen the city\u2019s financial burdens. At least that\u2019s the logical assumption. Of course, the city must conduct a study of the economic and social impacts that this new venture would bring, then decide whether or not to go forward with the plans.One way or another, the city hasn't approved final plans to build a casino, and this expression of interest is not the final say on the matter. \u00a0But it seems that with the Rideau-Carleton Raceway and the Casino do Lac-Leamy nearby, gambling addicts have access to gambling already. It makes little sense to not allow the development of a casino for that reason. The Rideau-Carleton Raceway will continue to operate with or without a casino in Ottawa and the Casino du Lac-Leamy in Gatineau serves the same purpose. Therefore, gambling addictions are likely to neither be lessened nor increased by the presence of a casino in the city (as opposed to across the Ottawa River). That\u2019s not to say that we should dismiss gambling addictions \u2013 that is a real problem that the community needs to address by looking at underlying socio-economic factors and other indicators. We should offer support services for those with a gambling addictions and offer counselling to those who need it. \u00a0However, when the city is strapped for funds and there is an opportunity to bring in more revenue to support the city\u2019s services, then why not take the opportunity?

    "body": "For an administration that purports to care about its veterans and soldiers, the Harper government\u2019s treatment of the National Defence and Canadian Forces Ombudsman over the past two weeks has been subpar at best. \r\r\u00a0Documents obtained first by the Ottawa Citizen show that this summer, the Canadian Forces leadership dismissed two reports by their ombudsman Pierre Daigle. These reports contained the findings of a five\u2013year investigation and concluded that defence department staff treated two former soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder unfairly. In a letter to Daigle in June, Rear Admiral Andrew Smith said the military watchdog was overstepping his jurisdiction. Daigle fired back in a letter of his own, accusing the military of not \u201caddressing the serious concerns of two former Canadian Forces members.\u201d Defence Minister Peter MacKay added his two cents at an international military ombudsman conference hosted by Daigle himself. He criticized Daigle and said that an ombudsman is simply a mediator who resolves complaints. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference from advocacy,\u201d opined the minister. This back-and-forth has spotlighted the actual role and tasks of an ombudsman. Is Daigle stepping into dangerous territory as suggested by MacKay? \u00a0Here\u2019s what the official mandate of the National Defence and Canadian Forces Ombudsman says: \u201cIn addition, the Ombudsman may investigate and report publicly on matters affecting the welfare of members and employees of the Department or the Canadian Forces and others falling within his jurisdiction.\u201d The complaints investigated by Daigle were from two former soldiers. This is well within the boundaries of Daigle\u2019s jurisdiction.\u00a0\u201cThis is the typical bureaucratic problem that all ombudsmen run into,\u201d says Sean Bruyea, a retired Canadian Air Force intelligence officer, and longtime advocate for Canadian veterans. \u201cIt\u2019s just bureaucratic avoidance.\u201d Bruyea says that whenever an ombudsman carries out an investigation and recommends more transparency, he is always met with a \u201cbarrage of bureaucratic excuses\u201d from the institution he oversees. \u00a0Bruyea was himself at the centre of the infamous \u201cPrivacy Scandal\u201d back in 2010. For years, Bruyea\u2019s advocacy for injured soldiers and their families has drawn the ire of large Canadian bureaucracies. A major scandal broke out when it was discovered that federal bureaucrats at Veterans Affairs Canada secretly passed Bruyea\u2019s confidential medical and financial documents to cabinet ministers. About 850 federal employees ended up having access to Bruyea\u2019s private life through those documents. Since then he has redoubled his efforts.\u00a0\u201cOf course, the ombudsman\u2019s task includes advocating on behalf of individuals in the face of huge bureaucracies,\u201d Bruyea says, \u201cpart of his job is to investigate complaints and issue recommendations as he sees fit.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s difficult to see the accuracy in Smith\u2019s accusations: Daigle seems to be well within his jurisdiction here. \u00a0The complaints he looked into were from employees of the Operational Stress Injury Social Support Program. The program is jointly run by the Defence Department and Veteran Affairs Canada, though both departments have refused to comment (as has Daigle\u2019s office). Two veterans originally hired as peer-suppourt co-ordinators complained that they were unfairly forced to leave their positions after disagreements with management. One, Master Cpl. Kevin Clark says that his final pay was clawed back to cover the days he missed due to illness.MacKay\u2019s comment on the difference between what he calls \u201cadvocacy\u201d and mediation is also rather misleading. As someone who is trying to send Canadians a message that the Conservatives care about veterans with injuries and stress issues, his lack of enthusiasm for advocating on behalf of the troops is strange. It can only be assumed then that Daigle\u2019s report is damaging to the overall image the Conservatives are trying to maintain, one that shows they care about veterans more than anyone else. \u00a0Daigle has praised the Conservatives and the defence department in the past for helping veterans with mental and physical health issues. However, when it comes to accepting his recommendations on specific issues, it seems that MacKay and the top brass of the Canadian Forces would rather protect that caring image. \u00a0Michael Blaise, co-founder of the non-profit group Canadian Veterans Advocacy and a former soldier himself, agrees. \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 record of care for our troops and veterans has been deplorable,\u201d Blaise says. \u201cThe professed vision of the DND Ombudsman\u2019s office is independence, impartiality and, most important, fairness for all.\u201d Blaise says that Daigle is simply fulfilling his mandate, and that this isn\u2019t the first time Minister MacKay has shown that he does not put veterans first. Blaise is permanently disabled from\u00a0 injuries he received while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces in Cyprus and Germany.\u00a0\u201cWho can forget Minister MacKay\u2019s promises to take care of our wounded through employment retention in the Canadian Forces at the height of the combat mission,\u201d Blaise says.\u201cThat promise has been broken, a shattering blow to the men, women and families who trusted the Conservative government when they were promised a life, a career, a future in the darkest moments of their lives.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt is time for change,\u201d he continued, \u201cit is time for this government to restore the sacred, lifetime obligation to those they send to war, and not abandon our wounded.\u201d ",

According to a 2009 survey by Health Canada, only four per cent of girls between the ages of five and 17 are meeting the suggested 60 minutes of physical exercise each day. Only nine per cent of boys are exercising enough.Rachel C. Colley, a researcher at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, says she thinks that lack of physical activity among girls is the result of an unenthusiastic approach to sports offered in schools.How to get females involved in sports is a question the Canadian government has been trying to tackle. The 1995 Federal Plan for Gender Equality was created with an eye towards women being given the same rights and quality of life as men. A main objective of the plan is to improve women\u2019s physical well-being by creating a health strategy that acknowledged the importance of various practices including an involvement in sports.GPI Atlantic, a non-profit research and education firm, published a report in 2003 titled, \u201cA Profile of Women\u2019s Health Indicators in Canada,\u201d aimed at examining how well the government\u2019s 1995 plan had faired.The report said a person\u2019s health could be affected by \u201csocial, cultural, economic and personal determinants of health,\u201d and stressed the social problem of inequality as a barrier against women in sports.Lizzie Armistead, an Olympic silver medallist in bicycle road racing at this year\u2019s London Olympics, used her platform as a successful athlete to speak about this problem to the Huffington Post in July. She called on other women to help conquer a biased sports environment.\u201cObviously if we join together, we\u2019ve got a stronger stance and I think it\u2019s something we do need to do,\u201d she said.Hockey is a prime example of a women\u2019s sport in Canada standing in the shadow of its male counterpart. For example, men\u2019s hockey made its Olympic debut in the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium, but women\u2019s hockey didn\u2019t appear at the Olympics until 1994. Had women\u2019s hockey been given such visibility earlier, young girls would have had more athletes to look up to and emulate. Women\u2019s football is another sport suffering from a lack of fulsome coverage. There is the Lingerie Football League, but what message are we sending to budding athletes by displaying half-dressed women play full-contact football? As a youngster, I was a swimmer. I started off confident but after placing second in a mixed final, I was with my first sexist remark. \"Boys are better than girls,\" said my instructor.I was eight years old. I lost my competitiveness. Regrettably, I quit soon after. Had I stuck it out, could I have been one of the role models clearly needed in female sports? Maybe, maybe not. But by quitting, I realize I\u2019ve been part of the problem.",

    "body": "Amanda Stephen, Centretown NewsMembers of Lisgar Collegiate's rugby team practise after school recently. The rugby team hosted an independent practice until their teacher representative continued coaching despite teacher protests.  Matthew Neville and the rest of the boys\u2019 junior soccer team will have to wait another year for their chance to bring home glory to Lisgar Collegiate Institute. \r\rAfter a miracle run to the Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations championships last season, Neville and his teammates will be sitting on the sidelines this fall.\u201cThis year we had probably an even stronger team with hopes of making it to provincials . . . and we couldn\u2019t even enter a team,\u201d says Neville, 17. Lisgar failed to register all but one sports team for the fall semester. The ongoing dispute between teachers unions and the Ontario government has seen the cancellation of many extracurricular clubs and sports due to lack of staff volunteers. This has left a strong feeling of discontent among the school\u2019s athletes \u2013 especially the senior ones who were hoping to represent the school one last time. \"My last chance at playing sevens rugby at Lisgar is gone,\u201d says Grade 12 student Cameron Fischer. \u201cPractices are still running however, and when the coach can\u2019t come students step up and run practices for themselves.\u201d But when it comes to larger events, the lack of staff volunteers is too big an obstacle to overcome. That\u2019s why the inaugural junior girls basketball Lisgar Collegiate Classic, which was supposed to be held in September, was cancelled. Only the golf team will be in full swing for Lisgar this fall with the future of winter sports still uncertain. In a Sept. 21 letter to parents and guardians, principal David McMahon said many schools in the region are having problems with the number of staff volunteers to supervise extracurricular clubs and sports activities. However, he assured parents the physical education department will be running some training sessions and scrimmages for players that would have been on fall teams. Sports teams play a large part in students\u2019 lives. Not just for the camaraderie they feel with their teammates or the sense of belonging to something, but also for college and university applications. Extracurricular activities can be the difference between getting accepted or rejected by a university, which is a concern for 17-year-old senior Sarah Seward-Langdon. \u201cI miss it. I\u2019m also worried about my university applications,\u201d says Seward-Langdon, who played badminton and soccer for Lisgar. \u201cIt always looks better on university applications to be involved in more. Although, I don\u2019t only do these things for the sake of my university applications, they are things that would have been good additions.\u201dWhile there will be a chance to for teams to continue to practice together, the situation is still unclear. John Ruff, head of physical education at Lisgar, declined comment. High school sports will be missing a lot of teams from a lot of schools this fall. Discussions for volunteers to allow for winter and spring competitions are ongoing but as of yet nothing has been decided. The whistle has blown for fall athletes at Lisgar but there still may be hope for the rest of the year.",

    "body": "The 2014 FIFA World Cup may still be over a year and a half away, but the Canadian men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s hopes \u2013 or better yet, dreams \u2013 of qualifying for the tournament could be determined in the next week. \r\rCanada's upcoming games against Cuba and Honduras will decide whether it moves on to the third and final stage of qualifying, or whether it\u2019s sent home packing. Again. It\u2019s been over 82 years since the first World Cup was played in Montevideo, Uruguay, and Canada hasn\u2019t appeared in the tournament since 1986 in Mexico. It was the first and only time the team has done so. Canada hasn\u2019t had much of a sniff at it since then, so there\u2019s no doubting the importance of the upcoming games. But whether or not it manages to sneak into the tournament, Canada needs to start thinking long term. Although the prospect of qualifying for soccer\u2019s most prestigious tournament should always be a goal, Canada has been wallowing in mediocrity with its current core of players for far too long. An overhaul is much overdue. In its disappointing 2-0 loss to Panama Sept. 12, Canada\u2019s starting lineup had an average age of 30 years old. It was already fighting an uphill battle. The best teams in the world, such as Spain and Germany, have proven to be successful with squads in their mid-20s. Of course, these powerhouse soccer nations have more young talent to choose from, but Canada should still follow the model they\u2019ve established. It\u2019s time to abandon ship and build a new one. Bring in some fresh blood, give them opportunities to play in important games, and let them grow together for the future. Realistically, the Canadian men\u2019s national team should be building towards the 2026 World Cup. Given that the CONCACAF region, which encompasses North America, Central America and the Caribbean, hasn\u2019t hosted the tournament since 1994, Mexico, the United States, or even Canada could be in line to do so come 2026. Canadian Soccer Association president Victor Montagliani confirmed in July that he has every intention of putting in a formal bid. Whether or not that bid is successful, there\u2019s a very good chance the tournament will be held close to home. What better time to arrive on the world scene with a competitive squad this country can be proud of? With 2026 still a way off, there\u2019s plenty of time to get this right. And that cannot be done without finding a new head coach.Aside from a brief stint as head coach in 2007, Stephen Hart has been with the Canadian men\u2019s national team since 2009. He\u2019s experienced some successes, but his overall tenure as head coach hasn\u2019t exactly inspired confidence. Hart may not be the problem, but neither is he the solution. Sometimes, a fresh voice and a fresh philosophy can make a world of difference. Take Canada\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team, for example. After a disastrous 2011 Women\u2019s World Cup in which Canada finished last in the 16-team tournament \u2013 equal in points with Equatorial Guinea \u2013 the CSA hired John Herdman to take the reins. And it worked. Although most will remember Christine Sinclair\u2019s sheer dominance that led Canada to bronze at the 2012 Olympic Games, she has more than once credited Herdman for the team\u2019s turn around. At age 37, Herdman is young, charismatic, and innovative. He\u2019s someone who the players want to play for \u2013 someone who inspires. The men need to find their Herdman (finding their Sinclair wouldn\u2019t hurt, either). Of course, a coach like him won\u2019t appear out of thin air. They don\u2019t grow on trees. But if the CSA got it right once, who\u2019s to say they can\u2019t do it again? A new coach and a new crop of players won\u2019t result in immediate success. Canadians may have to accept watching a sub-par team for the next round of World Cup qualifiers, and maybe even the ones after that. But if that\u2019s the price to pay for fielding a competitive team down the road, then it\u2019s worth every penny. At this point, there\u2019s really nothing to lose \u2013 but so much to gain. ",

    "body": "Above is an example of an eScooter. Below is an example of an eBike.  Longboarders, in-line skaters and eBike users may soon get a better idea as to where exactly they belong on Ottawa\u2019s roads and recreational pathways.\r\rCapital Coun. David Chernushenko asked for information about the city\u2019s policies for users of alternative modes of transportation in a formal inquiry to the transportation committee in early September. \u201cWhat is being done or can be done to provide greater clarity regarding the use of alternative modes of transportation on Ottawa roads and sidewalks, and, ideally, to encourage legal, safe and more predictable adoption of these modes of transportation?\u201d he asked at the time. People who get around using alternative modes of transportation, such as skateboards, scooters, and roller blades, are currently in a state of \u201clegal limbo,\u201d says Chernushenko. He says this creates confusion for users, who may be ticketed inconsistently by police left to interpret the situation as best they can.\u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to do it on the sidewalk and they\u2019re not allowed to do it on the road. So either way, it\u2019s illegal,\u201d says Chernushenko. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s a perfectly valid mode of transportation for some people and the kind of thing I\u2019d like to encourage, but encourage in a legal way. So, find a way that it can be legal and determine under what sort of rules.\u201dIn a response to the inquiry, the Ottawa Police Service emphasized that they can only enforce rules prescribed in current legislation. \u201cThe guiding documents OPS uses are the Highway Traffic Act and the Ottawa city bylaws, which lay out the current rules on what can and cannot be used on roads and highways. Regardless of the mode of transit citizens wish to use, our priority is safety on our roadways.\u201d So far, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has only legislated the use of eBikes. Users must be over the age of 16, wear a helmet and follow the same rules of the road as regular bicycles, according to the current rules. The city could create bylaws to impose further eBike restrictions on roads it maintains, as it did in February 2011 with the creation of the Rural Pathway Shared-Use Policy. The policy allows eBike users to ride on rural pathways in Osgoode, Prescott and Russell. In its response to Chernushenko\u2019s inquiry, the city indicated it will soon \u201cdevelop appropriate policies for eBikes and eScooters covering\u00a0pathways and bike lanes within the urban area.\u201d The Rural Pathway Shared-Use Policy does not include rules for longboards or in-line skates, and the city made no mention about creating policies for these modes of transportation in their response to Chernushenko\u2019s inquiry. Still, the definition of an eBike remains unclear for some users. An eBike looks like a traditional bicycle and is assisted by a battery, but riders are still required to pedal. An eScooter, however, is powered solely by a battery and does not resemble a traditional bicycle. \u201cThere is sort of a blurred distinction between an electric-assisted bicycle all the way up to an electric scooter. That\u2019s where differing jurisdictions have had to decide if they\u2019re allowed on the road, in the bike lane, on the NCC recreational pathways,\u201d says Chernushenko. \u201cThere are sort of different rules for different places and again, sort of lack of clarity that makes it tough to decide: Is it worth me buying one if I can\u2019t use it?\u201dThe Ottawa Police Service says there may still be work to do to clarify rules for users.\u201cMaybe there is an educational component that we must address, that we should address, to make sure people understand it,\u201d says Const. Marc Soucy. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had that many eBikes yet but they\u2019re still obligated to follow the rules of the road like a bicycle would be.\u201dThe National Capital Commission created rules for eBikes for the pathways in its jurisdiction in May. The NCC allows the use of eBikes, but doesn\u2019t permit eScooters on its Capital Pathway Network, says Jasmine Leduc, a representative for the NCC. \u201cThe rules aim to improve accessibility on the Capital Pathway Network,\u201d says Leduc. \u201cThe NCC also wants to promote sustainable mobility on its pathways. The scooter-type eBikes pose a greater risk to safety in the event of a collision, for example. Also, the NCC is promoting eBikes that require some muscular power to promote active mobility on the pathways.\u201dThere are two such pathways that run along the northern and eastern edges of Centretown. The NCC doesn\u2019t prohibit longboards or in-line skates. Chernuskeno says while he would like a homegrown solution, he will likely need to lobby the province for new rules.\u201cFrom what I can tell, it looks like I\u2019m kind of starting from scratch. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any work currently being done to legitimize the longboard, as one example, and the category of electric-assisted vehicles,\u201d says Chernushenko. \u201cReally, it would be more working with my colleagues in Ottawa to try to get the province to make modifications.\u201d ",

A leader of Ottawa\u2019s Vietnamese-Canadian community has been chosen as one of the country\u2019s \u201cTop 25 Immigrants\u201d for 2012, an honour reflecting Ai Thien Tran\u2019s dedication to numerous causes, including the planned Vietnamese Boat People Museum in Centretown. \r\rIn addition to being a probation officer at the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services, Tran is currently co-ordinator of fundraising for the museum set to start construction in 2013 at 105 Preston St. Tran is the first Vietnamese-Canadian to win one of Canada\u2019s Top 25 Immigrant Awards, presented by Canadian Immigrant Magazine in May and sponsored by the RBC banking corporation. This year,\u00a0 more than 28,000 Canadians voted online to choose the top Canadian immigrant, the largest number of participants since the award program began in 2009. \u201cNewcomers bring their unique skills and talents, which benefit us all and enrich Canada\u2019s productivity and diversity,\u201d says Paul Sy, director of\u00a0 multicultural markets at RBC.Tran was nominated by Dr. Daphne Nahmiasn, his former professor at McGill University.\u201cI was surprised but felt proud when I was told that I had,\u201d says Tran. \u201cI also felt proud because I shared this honor alongside with some of the most incredible community leaders who represented their communities across Can-ada.\u201dTran began his journey when he left Vietnam in 1989 as a 20-year-old boat person. After spending 12 years as a refugee in the Philippines, he married a long-lost friend who had previously immigrated to Montreal and re-established contact with him. In 2001, she sponsored him to come to Canada. Although faced with many obstacles as a newcomer to Canada, Tran showed great determination. He enrolled in the social work program at McGill University and graduated with honours. In 2006, Tran won the Golden Key award, which recognizes individuals for academic excellence while balancing additional commitments, such as family, career and community leadership. Tran is actively involved in the Vietnamese Canadian Federation and the Ottawa Parole Office\u2019s citizen advisory committee. The Vietnamese Boat People Museum project was launched\u00a0 in 2005 by the Vietnamese Canadian Federation and in 2009 organizers secured the proposed site on Preston Street. Although construction on the museum has not yet begun, it is slated to start in 2013 and open in 2015.In the 1970s, Canada received\u00a0 numerous Vietnamese refugees and a large number made their way to Ottawa between 1979 and 1982. A significant number came to Ottawa because of Marion Dewar, Ottawa\u2019s mayor at that time,\u00a0 implemented Project 4000, an effort to find sponsors for 4,000 Vietnamese refugees. In 1995, the Vietnamese Commemorative Monument was unveiled at the corner of Preston and Somerset streets to show the contributions of the Vietnamese community, something that the museum will showcase as well. Yasir Naqvi, MPP for Ottawa Centre, said the museum, \u201cwill serve as a testament to the sacrifices they made, instilling pride within the Vietnamese community, and allowing the greater community a chance to learn and understand the challenges the Boat People faced.\u201dNaqvi says he\u2019s confident there will be success in the federation\u2019s vision to create a world-class museum that celebrates the Vietnamese \u2013Canadian heritage. The purpose of the museum is to showcase the flight to freedom of Vietnamese refugees, most of whom\u2013 like Tran \u2013 fled the country by boat.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNever give up hope, no matter what happens in our lives,\u201d is Tran's advice to immigrants who are new to Canada. \u201cMy favourite motto is that \u2018The only thing that stands between a person and what he or she wants to do in life is the will to try it and the faith to believe it is possible.",

    "body": "Amanda Stephen, Centretown NewsSlam captain Kim \"Kimbit\" Nguyen and other members of her slam team travelled to Saskatoon to compete in the Canadian Festival for Spoken Word. Verses spat crackling like bonfire sparks or crooned honeysuckle-sweet, paired with eloquent gestures and jarring movements while poets prowl and strut to the rhythm. \r\rThis is slam poetry. This is why eight poets bussed, flew, and even hitchhiked to Saskatoon earlier this month. They\u2019re competing in the Canadian Festival for Spoken Word and it\u2019s not for the non-existent prize money, says Capital Slam team captain Kim \u201cKimbit\u201d Nguyen. The two teams \u2013 Urban Legends and Capital Slam \u2013 are in it for the title and to win bragging rights for a city where some say slam poetry is on the brink of renaissance and extinction.This wasn\u2019t always true. The festival may be taking place in Saskatchewan this year, but its roots are in Centretown. The first festival took place in 2004 at Library and Archives Canada, back when it was still known as the Canadian Spoken Wordlympics.Burning out and flaring up just seems to be the name of the slam poetry game in this area, says Sean Hyatt, of the Daily Grind art cafe.\u00a0\u201c(Slam poetry) pops up every couple of years, becomes big, then drops off again,\u201d he says. But if this theatrical style of poetry is to make a comeback, he says, Centretown\u2019s diversity makes it the ideal place - and not just because it launched a national competition six years ago. Unlike suburban areas, Centretown is a melting pot of all kinds of people from different socio-economic backgrounds. This makes for fertile ground for new growth.\u201cIn the suburbs there\u2019s a membrane separating . . . different demographics,\u201d Hyatt says. \u201cHere, there\u2019s not so much a membrane. It\u2019s a mishmash of everybody.\u201dBut across the street at Umi Cafe, barista John Bainbridge says slam is still big in Ottawa. The scene just went underground.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge artistic scene in Ottawa that just isn\u2019t tapped by anything. Nobody cares, nobody listens, nobody sees it,\u201d Bainbridge says. \u201cIt\u2019s all very underground.\u201dNguyen\u2019s teammate, Khaleefa \u201cApollo the Child\u201d Hamdan, says he agrees.\u201cThe way that the CFSW works is they rotate between the five cities with the biggest scenes,\u201d says Hamdan. Ottawa has hosted it twice \u2013 once in 2004, and then again in 2010.The second time around, Ottawa is not only the host, but also the national champion. Bainbridge says this victory helped bring recognition to both the scene and the poets, and some began changing the way they wrote.When she first started performing at Umi Cafe\u2019s open mic events, Nguyen says she wrote a lot about breakups and heartbreak. As she became more well-known, she says she began to see the impact her words could have.\u201cI realized I should probably say things that people needed to hear, rather than just my own problems,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to target other issues.\u201d Her recent poems deal with topics like suicide and hunger in the nation\u2019s capital, but slam poetry isn\u2019t all about politics and activism. \u201cIt\u2019s everything from poetry about your mother to poetry about socio-economics bordering on rants,\u201d says Hyatt of the slam poetry he\u2019s heard at the Daily Grind\u2019s occasional poetry-themed open mic nights. By opening up to new subjects, the poets also open themselves up to new audiences, says Bainsbridge. \u201cWhen you start in with political messages, at some point you have to talk about solutions as much as the problems,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much angry ranting you can listen to in an evening.\u201dIn Centretown, the slam poetry scene relies on open mic nights. But Ottawa\u2019s two slam teams have made names for themselves on the outskirts of the area.Capital Slam is held at the Mercury Lounge, which tends to be more of a wildcard audience-wise. Anyone can wander in, says Nguyen. Urban Legends, nestled in the Pit of Carleton University\u2019s Architecture building, is harder to find. This makes the scene more intimate, Nguyen says, because the audience is smaller and usually made up of other poets. But she has a simple solution for finding slam events in any area.\u201cJust Google it,\u201d she says. Between Capital Slam and Urban Legends, there\u2019s a slam poetry event for every weekend.",

    "body": "Okay, so what\u2019s all the buzz about this slam poetry going around? No, it\u2019s not a new business venture between Oxford University and the WWE. Slam poetry is a type of performance art that combines rhythm and writing to create a unique blend of soul-inspired verse that throws back to rap\u2019s original purpose as a means to actually express a point. \r\rSurprisingly enough, people are actually starting to listen and the movement is gaining serious speed, even in Ottawa. But what\u2019s really interesting is that slam poetry is doing what no one else could, bringing hip-hop back to its roots and making poetry culturally relevant again. And the best part is? The kids are loving every minute of it. It\u2019s hard to say exactly where hip hop lost its way, but it\u2019s been a long time since artists such as Tupac and Biggie Smalls used it as a platform to express the angst and frustration of what they saw as a lost and subjugated generation of young black Americans. But somewhere along the way, hip-hop artists started making money, a lot of money, the game changed and the focus went from words to want \u2013 maybe something to do with the mo\u2019 money, mo\u2019 problems principle. Regardless, we\u2019ve come to a point where rap and hip-hop don\u2019t speak to people in the same way they used to, or at least, not the same people. Then again, who can really say when poetry stopped being cool; no fingers pointed, but MTV or the electric guitar are usually at fault for a lot of these things. The days of poet playboys like Byron and Keats are long since over, and though the prose-defying pen still retains a certain sexy quality, it\u2019s usually reserved for the more artistically pretentious who wouldn\u2019t share it with the likes of us everyday folk, \u201cyou just really wouldn\u2019t get it.\u201d Kids don\u2019t want to write poetry, they won\u2019t want to study poetry either, because unless they find themselves in a yellow wood with two divulging roads ahead of them, traditional poetry is now the road not travelled at all. What slam poetry gives us is a little mix of both worlds where new age soul can blend with the structured nature of poetry to create something new and vibrant, something that has an appeal that goes farther than the coffeehouse spotlight. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s serving as in intergenerational and intercultural lubricant, a kind of weird purgatory where suddenly it\u2019s cool to like poetry without needing bongos, a beret and tinted Jon Lennon shades with a burning cigarette at your tips.Now, for the first time, we\u2019re seeing poetry drop the pretentious fa\u00e7ade and move toward something tangible that actually appeals and speaks to young people, because hey, all the cool kids are doing it. It may not have the mass appeal of 50 Cent or the timeworn street cred of a T.S. Elliot scribble, but slam poetry is making people remember why we do this in the first place: because there's something inside that needs to come out by whatever means necessary. Welcome to the future of the spoken word ladies and gentlemen. If you\u2019re not already paying attention, you should start tuning in. ",

All submissions must be originals and will be accepted from Oct. 16-27. Alison Kakish, founder of the Cock Show, says many Ottawa artists actually have a difficult time establishing themselves in the city\u2019s galleries because most have guidelines limiting how many local artworks can be housed at one time. \u201cSo places like restaurants are great for people to display their artwork and just be a part of the community,\u201d she says.Shelley Braun, artistic director of the show, says it took on a \u201clife of its own\u201d this year and had people asking about it even before details were announced.\u201cThere is so little space in Ottawa for people to show, that as soon as people find out that we might be willing to put their art on the wall, they come here,\u201d Braun says.Kakish, who only started making art about a year after Atomic Rooster opened, says a tribute to the rooster was an \u201cinstant idea\u201d and a way to contribute to the bar\u2019s identity.\u201cIt was my first idea and everybody loved it and it\u2019s just kept on going,\u201d she adds. People can vote for their favourite artwork on Facebook in the days leading up to the show or at Atomic Rooster\u2019s artist meet and greet on Nov. 6.

Unlike past shows, the winner will also receive a $200 gift certificate to splurge at Wallack\u2019s Art Supplies. The Atomic Rooster is one of many restaurants in the city, including Irene\u2019s Pub in the Glebe and Shanghai Restaurant at Somerset Street and Bronson Avenue, that are involved in hosting frequent art shows.\u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to help local artists,\u201d says Mabe Kwan, Shanghai Restaurant\u2019s manager.

The city has a new lethal weapon against the wood boring pests ravaging the city\u2019s ash trees, but it could hold environmental implications, according to the federal department of natural resources.\r\rConfidor is an injection insecticide that Ottawa and Toronto are testing to combat the rapidly spreading infestation of the emerald ash borer across Ontario. Previously used in the U.S. and approved by Health Canada last year, the insecticide will be used on a small number of trees. The new chemical will be compared on a trial basis with the city\u2019s current tree injection of choice, TreeAzin. \u201cThis trial program will allow researchers to assess the effectiveness of this insecticide and the injection system on ash trees in Ontario,\u201d\u00a0says Nichole Hoover-Bienasz, assistant to River Coun. Maria McRae, chair of the city\u2019s environment committee.\u00a0 \u201cThe city is making a concerted effort to help researchers find solutions or methods to help preserve ash trees.\u201d McRae and Mayor Jim Watson revealed the addition to the arsenal two weeks ago at a home in South Ottawa. The city\u2019s other strategies against EAB include planting other species of trees and removing highly infested ones. Last spring, the city planted 1,267 trees in streets and parks where ash trees are present, says Bienasz. An additional 2,700 trees will be planted this fall, she says. The pest arrived in North America on improperly treated wood imported from Asia in the early 2000s. It exclusively attacks ash trees by burrowing underneath its bark, inhibiting its ability to absorb nutrients and take in water. The damage is exclusively done by the insect\u2019s larvae form, which creates tunnels when feeding in tree trunks, branches and roots. \u201cThe synthetic insecticide Confidor is highly toxic to emerald ash borer and is likely to be very effective assuming a proper formulation that can be taken up by the tree, Michelle Viau,\u00a0 a department of natural resources official, said in an email. While Confidor may be more effective against the borer, the\u00a0 department has raised concerns that it may have a longer-lasting environmental impact because trees retain the insecticide\u2019s active ingredient for a prolonged period of time. This can go on to harm non-target species and inhibit leaves from decomposing in the fall, an essential source of nutrients in soil. TreeAzin\u2019s active ingredients, meanwhile, are natural compounds absorbed by trees.\u201cWith its demonstrable efficacy and favourable environmental (benefits), TreeAzin would appear particularly well suited to use in urban or sensitive ecological environments,\u201d the department spokeswoman said. Ash trees comprise 25 per cent of the city\u2019s tree population. In Centretown, pockets of ash trees grow in St. Luke\u2019s Park, Minto Park and on the grounds of the Jack Purcell Community Centre. The alien beetle invasion infested several of the ash trees found at Jack Purcell. In response, the city and the Jack Purcell Park Project planted five maple trees on the property in June 2011. Centretown residents use the revamped dog park at Jack Purcell Park, still shrouded by ash trees. \u201cThis is a gorgeous park and the ash trees here are a big part of that,\u201d says Sam Lafleur, a frequent visitor of the park with her beagle-pug mix, Koby.\u201cThese trees need to be protected \u2013 at any cost,\u201d she says.

One that is family friendly, that is very relaxed and casual.\u201dThe Ottawa craft beer scene is growing with new microbreweries opening up. According to Enright, that makes it the perfect moment to introduce the brewery market concept in Ottawa.\u201cI have been doing things in the beer world for over 10 years and once upon a time Ottawa didn\u2019t have a whole lot of craft beer,\u201d he says. \u201cBut these past few years there\u2019s been a new renaissance for beer in Ottawa.

Big Rig is one of the newest microbreweries in Ottawa and brewmaster Lon Ladell is excited to be taking part in the event. \u201cIt\u2019s a creative way to introduce people to new products and I think there is a demand for it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring three different beers to the market and I will bring samples of our ingredients.\u201dThe Ottawa Brewery Market is an an opportunity for established and new breweries and to cometogether in the same place, says Patrick Fiori, the brewmaster and manager of the Clocktower pubs. \u201cThe more other breweries come up, the more exposure people get to craft beers and the more people want to try ours and vice versa with other brands.

As new residents moved last month into the final phase of the Beaver Barracks housing project, the president of the Centretown Citizens Ottawa Corp., Calinda Brown, hailed the \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d development as key to rejuvenating the city\u2019s downtown. \r\rThe CCOC provides affordable housing to Ottawa residents and owns more than 50 properties around the city. Beaver Barracks is one of the city\u2019s largest rental housing projects with 254 units. The construction of the project has been separated into two phases: the first phase being the apartment buildings at 464 Metcalfe St. and 160 Argyle St. which have been completely occupied since December 2010. The second and final phase which includes the townhouses at Victory Gardens Private and the apartment building at 111 Catherine St. which began occupancy this September. Beaver Barracks is wheelchair accessible, smoke-free and environmentally friendly, with a roof top garden on the Metcalfe building. However, one of CCOC\u2019s biggest achievements has been bringing families back to Centretown and Beaver Barracks has done just that, says Brown. It\u2019s a goal, she adds, that dates to the organization\u2019s origins in 1974.She says it started with a group of Centretown citizens who were \u201ca\u00a0 little dismayed at the building and destruction of neighbourhoods.\u201d She says people realized they were losing downtown housing to office buildings and the proposed off-ramp that would connect people to Parliament Hill. Brown says the organization was formed out of a need to preserve family homes in Centretown. \u201cThe organization started buying single family homes in Centretown so that affordable housing would remain in the area.\u201d Brown says the organization is proud to be housing about 100 children and their families at Beaver Barracks. \u201cOne of our big goals has been to create family-friendly spaces, because we know families want to live downtown again. I think we succeeded.\u201d \u201cPeople are tired of spending all their available time in cars,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen they could walk home and be with their kids in 20 minutes.\u201d Although living downtown is convenient, it\u2019s not always affordable for families. \u201cThere\u2019s a real shortage of affordable rental housing, and it\u2019s a big accomplishment for us and the partners in the City of Ottawa to do something on this scale,\u201d says\u00a0 CCOC executive director Ray Sullivan.John Adeyefa, a resident of Beaver Barracks who moved into one of the second phase townhouses at Victory Gardens Private this September, called it a privilege to live there. \u201cIt\u2019s central to everything, there\u2019s no need to have a vehicle.\u201d Adeyefa has lived in Canada for a few years and his wife and three children joined him in Ottawa about six months ago from Africa. \u00a0His children enjoy playing around Beaver Barracks, climbing on the elephant statues and playing soccer at the park beside the Museum of Nature,\u2019 Adeyefa says. He notes that Beaver Barracks is his children\u2019s first home in Canada and he looks forward to seeing them grow up in the Centretown area. Residents will continue to move into the second phase of Beaver Barracks and it should be completely occupied by mid-November, says Meg McCallum, CCOC\u2019s manager of membership and communications.

Housing re-sales across Ottawa fell in September for a second consecutive month, but Centretown remained insulated from these trends, according to figures compiled by the Ottawa Real Estate Board. \r\rCentretown appears immune to a downturn in the Ottawa real estate market, which also dipped by 14 per cent in August compared with the same period in 2011, and then dropping by 17 per cent last month compared with September 2011. But re-sales were steady in Centretown, with figures matching or beating August and September 2011. High demand in downtown neighbourhoods is fueled by older buyers who want to be close to services such as hospitals, says Sandra Perez Torres, a senior market analyst with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. \u201cA lot of of baby boomers, a lot of empty-nesters, they\u2019re selling the bigger properties, and they\u2019re moving closer to the downtown, where they can have easier access to hospitals, doctors, clinics and whatnot,\u201d says Perez Torres, adding that young white-collar workers also gravitate towards urban centres. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly young professionals that want to be closer . . . to restaurants, where the action is, in the downtown,\u201d she says. New housing in these downtown areas tends to take the shape of high-rise buildings such as the condo towers rapidly appearing on the Ottawa skyline, she says. Since high demand makes land prices spike, developers tend to build vertically. But high prices are causing some young professionals to think twice about investing in Centretown real estate. \u201cIf you do the math, it makes more sense to rent than to buy at this point, because you don\u2019t have to pay the condo fees or the property taxes, or all those extras,\u201d says Camille Lem, after viewing a rental property in Centretown with her husband, a doctor in the biotech industry, and their young son.\u201cEven the rental prices have gone up significantly since three years ago,\u201d she says, adding that as renters, she and her husband can more easily move to pursue business opportunities elsewhere. The average price of housing units sold in Centretown this year (up to the end of September) was more than $400,000, while the average Ottawa-wide price was just over $353,000, according to figures from the Ottawa Real Estate Board. Real estate broker Robert Hof says Ottawa is a good bet for investors due to factors such as \u201ccash for life\u201d among residents with government jobs and high disposable incomes causing the market to remain stable.He downplays the recent downturn in sales across Ottawa, noting that the overall figure for units sold was up by nearly one per cent at the end of September compared with the same period last year. \u201cPeople have to differentiate the situation between Ottawa and the rest of the country,\u201d Hof says.\"We\u2019ve never had these large swings, these up and down cycles that the rest of the country has.\u201d Ansel Clarke, president of the Ottawa Real Estate Board, says ongoing fears of layoffs among federal civil servants may be contributing to the recent slump Ottawa-wide. \u201cI think people still are jittery,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cEverybody is taking a wait-and-see attitude.\u201d ",

But if the community wants to attract businesses, it needs to offer more family-friendly housing.While Ottawa neighbourhoods such as Hintonburg and New Edinburgh have seen property values skyrocket and local businesses take off, Centretown has remained stagnant over the past few years.City councillors are rezoning land to accommodate glossy high-rise buildings that are supposed to \u201cintensify\u201d the neighbourhood and bring in business. Centretown is the city\u2019s leader in high-rise development; according to city data, 193 large multi-storey buildings were built in the neighbourhood this past quarter. Towers on Lisgar, McLeod and Gladstone have already sprung up and new projects on Preston and Bronson promise to reach heights of more than 30 storeys. The hope is that by raising the skyline local businesses will also soar. But without proper urban planning, Centretown\u2019s condo boom will do little for creating long-term business growth. in the community Proponents claim that building high-rise condominiums will attract young professionals with money to burn, which will bring new businesses to set up shop in the area. Bright and shiny condos such as the proposed 30-storey SoHo Italia on Preston Street promise New York-style living in Canada\u2019s capital. Who wouldn\u2019t want that?Well, most people in Ottawa, that\u2019s who.Ottawa is a government town, always was and always will be. What drives people to move to Ottawa isn\u2019t the thrill and excitement of city life, it\u2019s the promise of a good job and a good pension. It\u2019s the kind of town where families like to settle. Condominiums, even sparkly baubles such as SoHo Italia, are generally small and have little access to green space. This is fine for young people without children or pets. But what family of four wants to live in a 56-square-metre apartment that costs $1,000 a month? What happens when 20-something Sam and Alex decide to buy the proverbial golden retriever and have kids? They move. And where do they move to?Hintonburg, New Edinburgh, Civic Hospital and Old Ottawa South. These are neighbourhoods with green space, one- or two-family houses and strong business improvement associations.These are the sorts of neighbourhoods where businesses want to stay.The far west corners of Centretown are starting to catch on. Fueled by the family-friendly Civic Hospital neighbourhood, Little Italy has made itself a destination for young urban families and the shops that cater to them. It has easy access to Dow\u2019s Lake, a community centre and affordable yet relatively spacious housing. A strong business improvement association supports local businesses and attracts new ones.All this came before SoHo Italia decided to reach for the sky. Making Centretown attractive to businesses means making it attractive to families. That means the community needs to have more than just the biggest, brightest condominiums on the block. It means investing in buildings that offer more than two bedrooms and it means investing in affordable housing. It also means investing in parks and community centres so that Sam and Alex can take their dog (and kids) out for a walk. Real community transformation requires not just a financial investment from homeowners and businesses. It requires an investment of both parties\u2019 time. Attracting young people with slick condos is easy; it\u2019s getting them to stay that\u2019s hard. ",

When David Narbaitz first dreamed of opening a board games caf\u00e9, he envisioned walls lined with colourful boxes of Monopoly and other classics, a display of snacks and sandwiches, and a bar serving a wide range of coffee, tea, and beer. \r\rNow his dreams are on the verge of becoming a reality. Monopolatt\u00e9, a brightly painted little caf\u00e9 on Somerset Street, only awaits city approval to open its doors to customers interested in sipping a drink while playing one of the 670 games Narbaitz has collected over the years.Narbaitz had previously hoped to open Monopolatt\u00e9\u2019s doors in August. The caf\u00e9 looks ready, but is still waiting on a city zoning permit. \u201cBefore, although this (building) was a bookstore, it was set to residential mode and now I have to reset it to commercial mode, and that requires a permit,\u201d says Narbaitz.\u00a0\u201cIf I knew what (the amount of time) is, I\u2019d be the happiest person in the world.\u201dAnxious to get started, Narbaitz calls this his \u201cdream job.\u201d \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in my element, like this is what I\u2019m meant to do. I\u2019m making people happy, helping them enjoy themselves. I guess that\u2019s who I am.\u201dThe concept of the caf\u00e9 is very similar to Snakes and Lattes in Toronto. There would be a $5 cover charge for patrons to come in and play as many games as they would like. The caf\u00e9 has received a warm welcome from most of the community. Shirley Sang of the Somerset Street Business Improvement Area says she is happy to have a different business concept taking shape in the area. \u00a0\u201cWe already have six or seven coffee shops (in the BIA), and three in that area,\u201d Sang says. \u201cEach has their own special feature, each brings their own culture and we are very happy.\u201d \u00a0Not everyone has received the news of Monopolatt\u00e9 with pleasure.

The Centretown Citizens Community Association is raising money for legal costs to appeal a city-approved condominium by organizing an electronic waste collection and getting funds from the city for e-waste.\r\rThe association is using the collection event to help residents return old electronics that are not collected in the normal curbside garbage and recycling pick-ups, says Robert Dekker, vice-president of the association.Electronics acceptable for collection include audio players, computer keyboards, laptop computers, telephones, televisions, and radios among many others.Old electronics have to be disposed of separately and it is the responsibility of residents to properly discard them. Dekker says the collection event on Oct. 6\u00a0 was an opportunity for residents to get rid of the electronics without having to take it to a waste disposal on the outskirts of the city. \u201cPeople are always replacing electronics, and the last thing we want to see are these things ending up in landfills,\u201d he says.The city will provide money for the recycled electronics and will calculate it by the tonne. Money raised from the e-waste event will go towards an appeal of a city council decision to approve a condominium development on 96 Nepean St.\u201cWe\u2019ve hired a planning consultant to do a preliminary report on our appeal, to give us opinions, and they don\u2019t come cheap,\u201d Dekker says.In August, the association filed an appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board seeking to overturn city council\u2019s approval of a 27-storey condominium in Centretown.CCCA official Judy Forrest says the organization expressed its concerns about the project to the city\u2019s planning committee, but councillors approved the build anyway. The current zoning bylaw allows only 12 storeys, and the development is far too big for the site, she adds.\u201cThey\u2019re building from lot line to lot line.

The desired effects include promoting pedestrian transportation and eco-friendly behaviour, as well as reducing traffic and suburban sprawl.\u201cThe pro-intensification bent of our organization is one of looking at change as a positive and trying to work with the change to make it as good as possible,\u201d says Ghosh. \u201cWe think that by being proactive we can get better results.\u201dIn the past year, 1,992 residential unit building permits were issued to areas targeted for intensification, which amounts to nearly a four per cent increase from 2010, according to the city\u2019s annual development report for 2011. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of good to be said for dense neighbourhoods. It\u2019s definitely a positive to live in a community where you can walk, cycle, and take transit to everything that you need,\u201d Ghosh says. \u201cI think increasing numbers of people want to live in those places, and if we don\u2019t provide them with an outlet, we\u2019re not doing anyone service.\u201d The rush of new developments, such as the Claridge and SoHo Italia condo projects, have led to concerns for current residents in these targeted areas, often over height, but Ghosh says he hopes Ottawa Urbanism can shift this debate.\u201cWe find that height is a galvanizing issue that needn\u2019t be and we\u2019d rather focus on design rather than height,\u201d he says.In addition to plans to liaise between residents and city hall, Ottawa Urbanism has already been in contact with downtown citizens\u2019 groups, such as the Centretown Citizens Community Association and the Dalhousie Community Association.Downtown community associations are regularly raising concerns about oversized buildings in the area, but DCA vice-president Eric Darwin says he thinks there is room for co-operation.\u201cThe groups have differences, but apparently some parts of our agendas overlap. For example, we both want more focus on the street level, on sidewalk capacity, and place-making,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think they would get the cold shoulder from some people who perceive their agenda as being too different from their own.\u201dIt is these individual community agendas that Ottawa Urbanism hopes to bring together.\u201cI think you have a lot of disparate agendas,\u201d says Lucia Harper, director of communications at Ottawa Urbanism. \u201cOne community will have one priority and another community will have a different one, so we\u2019d like to unify some of these messages by bringing people together and working with these community associations.\u201dGhosh agrees that working together is essential.\u201cWe all want to co-operate together because the goal is the same, to make Ottawa the best it can be,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are just two different outlets for citizens to communicate that to city hall.\u201dAttempting to address the concerns of multiple communities will be a big task, says Darwin.\u201cIf they want to go to community association meetings and be a voice out there for the larger picture, go for it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if there\u2019s 30 community associations and each meets once a month, plus they\u2019ll have their own meetings, it\u2019ll be time consuming.\u201dAs Ottawa changes, Ghosh says he hopes Ottawa Urbanism can help people see what the future of the city will be. \u201cWe are a metropolis, but we don\u2019t acknowledge that fact. I think by acknowledging it and putting forward a vision of what a big city Ottawa is going to be, we can achieve a better city.\u201d",

Four days later, the list was at its 150-person capacity and had to close again. Lynsey James, director of primary care services at the Centretown centre, says that while dealing with the shortage of doctors is tricky, the health centre is constantly searching for ways to improve both the access and delivery of care.\u201cThere are always opportunities to look for inefficiencies and improve so that we can try to see more patients, and we continue to do that this year,\u201d says James.She also noted that most of the new patients who were added to the waiting list at the Cooper Street centre will be able to be seen by a doctor before 2013. But there are other options for residents without a family doctor, says Jones from the Somerset centre, located on Eccles Street in Chinatown.\u201cSomerset West offers a walk-in clinic, and that clinic is available to anyone that lives in our catchment area.\u201d\u201cThey do not need to have a family provider here to use that service,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt is an opportunity to receive quality health care in our community while waiting for a permanent health care provider.\u201dThe root of the shortage at the area\u2019s health centres \u2013 a shortage that is not unique to Ottawa \u2013 is demand for services that\u2019s simply outweighing the supply, says Mary MacNutt, of the Association of Ontario Health Centres.\u201cWe recognize that there are many people in Ontario that still have difficulty getting just the very basic access to care,\u201d says MacNutt. \u201cHowever, I think that improvements have been made in the past few years, just in terms of increasing access to family physicians.\u201dAnother problem, MacNutt says, is with the way care is provided in Ontario. \u201cThe province needs to get a better balance of how it spends its health care dollars, and right now, we need to put more emphasis on community based services like community health centres that keep people well in the first place,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re getting high value for the health care dollars that are invested.\u201dCommunity health centres focus on health as a complete package, addressing mental, physical and emotional health.They also aim to help individuals overcome barriers that might limit their access to local health care. \u201cWe talk about education, housing, we talk about food security, we talk about income \u2013 because all of those things are such factors in peoples\u2019 physical health,\u201d says Jones.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s about keeping people well in all kinds of areas.\u201dMacNutt says efforts to extend care to all parts of a community are essential. \u201cOften we do think of health as just something you get in a medical clinic. And health is much more than that. It really begins in our community. If we have healthy communities, that means we\u2019re going to have healthy people.\u201d",

Police services, the justice system and emergency acute care costs thousands of dollars a day to manage homeless people, while supportive housing costs only about $30 per day per individual, says Lorraine Bentley, chair of the Supportive Housing Network of Ottawa.The Cornerstone Foundation\u2019s Booth Street centre is one of the 16 sites in Ottawa that are part of the city\u2019s supportive housing network. Cornerstone offers permanent, secure and affordable housing for 42 women who have had \u201csome form of mental illness, may have had addictions, or been abused in their life,\u201d says Carol Burrows, chair of the foundation\u2019s Journey of Hope campaign. The campaign has raised $2.4 million for the Booth Street centre.Although the Cornerstone Foundation initially received federal and provincial funding, Burrows says obtaining consistent financial backing for supportive housing is a challenge. \u201cThe City of Ottawa is putting a good sum into affordable housing each year, but a lot of that is going to repairs of existing stock,\u201d she says.Bay Coun. Mark Taylor, chair of the city\u2019s community and protective services committee, says Ottawa is making good progress in terms of implementing and expanding supportive housing.Part of the reality is that most support systems for homeless people are in the downtown core, says Taylor, which is why they tend to linger in the downtown.\u201cWe have something called the Transitional Emergency Shelter Program \u2013 we\u2019re trying to take homeless folks out of the downtown core and give them shelter opportunities or housing opportunities across the entire city, so that they don\u2019t necessarily have to be immersed with people who will take advantage of them,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking at other opportunities to do that.\u201d",

The honour from the Brain Injury Association of Canada recognizes the city\u2019s commitment to head-injury prevention through its new helmet policies as well as numerous social media campaigns.\r\rHarry Zarins, executive director of the Brain Injury Association of Canada, says this mix of strategies is what has made the program so successful in Ottawa.\u201cPolicy is good, but education is also so, so important. Education is the No. 1 way that people can make the choice of whether or not they should wear a helmet.\u201d At the beginning of the year, the city passed a new policy which would require any skaters under the age of 10 \u2013 or inexperienced skaters of any age \u2013 to wear a helmet while skating at city-owned rinks.The annual Skate Safe tent on the Rideau Canal is another program in the city\u2019s toolbox that promotes helmet use. Since 2004, the booth has been located on the skateway and volunteers offer tips and help with helmet fitting, as well as free skating sessions.The city also took to social media to encourage youth to don head protection in a cute and catchy way. The most recent \u201cAdopt a Helmet\u201d campaign describes buying a helmet as a lifelong commitment, and the steps involved in making a helmet a part of your family are similar to adopting a new pet. \u201cSome people just fall in love with a helmet at first sight. For others, it may take some adjustment to get used to,\u201d advises the website at www.adoptahelmet.com.Zarins says Ottawa Public Health\u2019s campaigns represent a fresh mix of ideas, which made it worthy of the BIAC award. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for innovation. They\u2019ve been very innovative with YouTube and social media. And whatever we can do to reduce brain injuries as the result of wearing a helmet is certainly worth promoting.\u201dJason Haug, a project manager at Ottawa Public Health, agrees that social media is key to reaching the youth audience. \u201cBecause of the social media component, the visibility has been higher. Especially with the \u201cAdopt a Helmet\u201d, which is our most recent social media campaign. It has been getting a lot more media coverage and a higher profile.\u201dThe award from the BIAC is also helpful for Ottawa Public Health in spreading its message.\u201cIt\u2019s great third-party credibility,\u201d says Haug. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognized organization that\u2019s saying to Ottawa Public Health that we\u2019re on the right track in terms of preventing head injuries. So it\u2019s great credibility for our organization and gives us validity that we\u2019ve done some work to benefit the community.\u201dOttawa parent Pam Dillon applauds the city\u2019s efforts to encourage helmet use: \u201cAs a mother, I shiver with dread when I see kids on bikes without helmets.\u201d She knows first-hand the devastating consequences of head injuries. \u201cI know a young person who was injured while playing shinny hockey at an outdoor rink. He was not wearing a helmet and was hit in the forehead with a puck. He has permanent brain damage that changed who he is and how he functions.\u201d ",

His job included mediating disputes between developers and communities, ensuring new developments bolster the existing feel of neighbourhoods, and providing input on Ottawa\u2019s overall design strategy, including on major projects, such as the LRT. The city refused to comment on why he was dismissed. Kilstrom\u2019s replacement, Lee Ann Snedden was the manager of the \u201cneighbourhood sustainability office.\u201d She has no prior city planning experience. Dekker, however, speculates she was brought in for another purpose.\u201cShe will be able to direct and push through pending applications and moving files along,\u201d Dekker says. \u201cI believe the city is waiting to see and is going to take a long, hard look for another city planner. Losing Richard was a big hit, but we're confident the city will find someone in due course.\u201dKilstrom\u2019s dismissal comes just weeks prior to the release of the CCCA\u2019s Community Development Plan, set to be presented to the council in December, says Dekker. What to expect, however, is not certain, he said.\u00a0 \u201cWe met with Coun. Peter Hume to get an idea of how the plan is progressing and what to expect,\u201d Dekker says. \u201cWe\u2019re really just playing the waiting game, though\u201d The Centretown CDP is a comprehensive plan aimed at providing a plan for development and intensification of the area for the next 20 years. It summarizes and digests information and advice from public consultations, dialogues with developers and a consulting firm, Urban Designers, according to city planner Robert Spicer. Spicer says the new plan will not be about sweeping alterations, but rather minor additions. The plan will take particular interest in property use designation, streetscaping and park beautification, he said. The lack of change may upset some players, however, including CCCA president Jordan Charbonneau. \u201cThe main thing we want is respect for residential character of our neighbourhood,\u201d Charbonneau said via email. \u201cWe are not a dumping ground for buildings the rest of the city doesn\u2019t want, nor are we willing to see the area become a primarily commercial district, devoid of life after 5 p.m.\u201dDekker added he wants councillors to take the new plan seriously, and not merely pass it off as a suggestion. \u201cSeveral properties with big square footage, extending every square inch of the property doesn\u2019t work. That\u2019s why we\u2019re protesting 96 Nepean St.,\u201d says Dekker, referring to a controversial proposed development approved by council in July. \u201cThe building is too big for the lot size, will sit right next to the property line and does not follow design guidelines.\u201d The development plan is created in accordance with the city\u2019s overall design plan, which is a binding legal document. Hence, councillors are required to grant approvals based on the existing rules or make amendments to allow clearance for new developments, said Spicer. Whatever appears in the plan, Charbonnneau has his own 20-year vision for Centretown. \u201cIt will be denser, more highly populated and taller,\u201d Charbonneau said. \u201cBut we fervently hope that it will also be more dynamic, greener and well serviced than it is now.

Don Stewart of the Federation of Urban Neighbourhoods (Ontario), an umbrella group for community organizations, said these lawsuits prevent people from volunteering and can be a serious financial threat.\u201cVolunteers in community groups face enough financial challenges when defending community interests without the threat of being sued by a deep-pocketed business,\u201d he said. \u201cJust paying a lawyer to defend you can represent a significant personal expense which would be a major deterrent to getting involved.\u201dNaqvi will bring the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2012 to Queen\u2019s Park on Monday, Oct. 15.

    "body": "Provided.Const. Khoa N. Hoang After more than a decade serving our downtown residents at the corner of Somerset and Bank, the Centretown Community Police Centre has moved into city hall. A decision that was made after floods, rent cost, and operational needs forced the Ottawa Police Service to place its downtown community office into the second floor of 110 Laurier Ave. West.\r\rIf real estate is all about location, than I suppose my new office is no exception. But working at city hall requires adapting to the challenges of being outside of a residential neighbourhood such as Centretown. After all, some would argue that we are no longer accessible to the community and therefore lost our original business model of community policing. Others, however, would argue that being surrounded by service providers and municipal politicians keeps us in the loop to be a more effective CPC.The Centretown Community Police Centre serves the central-west district neighbourhoods of the Golden Triangle, Old Ottawa East, Centretown, Glebe, and Old Ottawa South. It had been at the corner of Somerset and Bank since the late 1990s. A lot of things have changed since then. Growing up along Bank Street in the \u201880s and \u201890s meant that I was exposed to a number of things that no longer exist. Bank Street used to be the main street in Ottawa; the place where everyone and anyone would go for just about everything. There were even a number of hotels that lined the street, including a large population of restaurants and bars \u2013 much more than there are now. Several major banks have closed their doors and I have fond memories of hanging out within the many\u00a0arcades\u00a0that were popular before home gaming systems took off.The original Somerset CPC was actually located inside the Dalhousie Community Centre within our Chinatown neighbourhood during the early \u201890s, which helped to address the street crime problems at that time.Eventually, problems along Bank Street caused concerns in the late \u201890s with a noticeable increase in prostitution, drugs, and gang activity. The corner of Bank and Somerset became a haven for criminal activity and the decision to move the Community Police Centre to that corner was approved. Officers began building partnerships and earning the trust of local residents. Several police projects were initiated to address the concerns. Eventually, we were able to get enough of a handle on the street crime that police could refocus their attention on education and relationship building, which is extremely important but often difficult with immediate crime concerns continuously emerging.Today, the corner of Bank and Somerset is much better off than it once was. Bank Street Promenade is a bustling business hub and a main vehicle route into our downtown core. Crime rates are significantly lower today than they were in the \u201890s and the community has a greater appreciation for policing. My role at the new location hasn\u2019t changed and neither has any of our contact information, which remains the same. But the work load has increased significantly with the addition of direct neighbours such as community service providers, the councillors\u2019 office, mayor\u2019s office, media outlets, and the Police Services Board, to name a few. There is an opportunity now to establish stronger relationships with many of our partners while still serving the residents that remain at the very top of my priority list.I hope that you\u2019ll take the time to drop by next time you\u2019re at city hall.",

Conditions set out in Ontario\u2019s Business Names Act state that businesses cannot register names that may mislead the public into believing they are an institution of a different kind.The restaurant\u2019s name comes from a desire to bring people together, \u201ca brotherhood of growers, cookers and eaters,\u201d said co-owner Ivan Gedz.The number 613 represents Ottawa\u2019s area code and reflects the restaurant\u2019s desire to be viewed as part of the community.Co-owner Matt Fantin said the province let them keep the name because of the brand recognition they have already created. In the months since the restaurant opened, they have spent time promoting their name on social media and money on items such as t-shirts. \u201cThe thing I like most about what happened,\u201d said Fantin, \u201cis seeing what can happen when society gets involved, the outcry from the public.\u201dHe said they have seen public support through Twitter and letter writing campaigns to MPPs. \u201cCustomers of ours and people who haven't even been here let MPPs know that they support us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been really valuable to us.\u201d",

Crime and the relocation of a community police centre dominated a meeting last week between Centretown-based BIAs and Ottawa\u2019s police chief. \r\rRepresentatives of Centretown merchants\u2019 associations told Chief Charles Bordelau that they are concerned with crime and policing issues, including a lack of communication with the police, questionable massage parlours and vandalism. Gerry LePage, executive director of the Bank Street BIA, expressed outrage at the relocation of the renamed Somerset Community Police Centre, now renamed the Centretown Community Police Centre, from Somerset Street West to city hall.He told Bordeleau that although the hours in the previous location were inadequate, the relocation is having a negative impact.\u201cNow, there is a breakdown in communication between our community and the police,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking the community police station away from the community makes no sense.\u201dBordeleau said the police had worked tirelessly to find a better location but found nothing within their budget.\u201cThe fact that it is in city hall doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d said Bordeleau. \u201cIt is still independent and community based,\u201d adding that there are no plans to change the location. LePage also said that there are numerous questionable massage parlours popping up. \u201cLooks can be deceiving and you can\u2019t make judgments on whether they are therapeutic or sell services which go beyond the purview of their stated services,\u201d LePage said in an interview later. \u201cI think it is something that the police service has to be cognizant about to ensure legitimacy and public safety.\u201d Grace Xin, executive director of the Somerset Street Chinatown BIA, was also vocal about crime in her area and unsatisfactory communication with the police.She said there had recently been three robberies that were reported to her BIA rather than to the police.\u201cWe used to have regular contact with the police, but not anymore. Our area has a high concentration of immigrants who are afraid of the police,\u201d she said.She said language barriers and the fact that in their former countries immigrants often weren\u2019t able to trust the police are reasons for this fear. Bordeleau told the BIAs that he will consider their recommendations when drawing up his crime strategy. Lori Mellor, executive director of the Preston Street BIA, said that while her community is usually safe, her main issues are with vandalism and graffiti.She said that the mural under the Queensway on Preston Street and the bollards, or short posts, are common targets for vandalism. She proposed putting cameras under the Queensway to monitor and deter vandalism. \u201cI know there aren\u2019t enough resources to have police cars sitting there all the time, so to put a camera there would be a good idea because I\u2019ve had a lot of complaints from business owners because reparations are often costly and time consuming,\u201d Mellor said.Days after the meeting the Preston Street BIA received an email from Valerie Bietlot, legal counsel to the City of Ottawa, which stated that the BIA will have to investigate whether surveillance cameras are appropriate and whether they will comply with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.In an effort to improve communication between the business community and city hall, Mayor Jim Watson has been holding quarterly meetings to inform all the BIAs in Ottawa about new developments that may affect them and to receive their input.

    "body": "An Ontario government decision to cut an important housing benefit is raising concerns among local social support agencies. \r\rEarlier this year, it was announced that the Community Start-Up and Maintenance Benefit is scheduled to end in January 2013. \u201cCommunity Start-Up is an absolutely essential fund for all people on (social) assistance to access housing and to make sure the housing is safe and affordable,\u201d says Carrie Lynn Poole-Cotnam, chair of Social Services Workers Co-ordinating Committee, which represents more than 30,000 social service workers in Ontario. For about 20 years, the benefit has helped low income earners secure and maintain housing. It provides up to $799 for a single person and $1,500 for families. People can access the benefit once every two years to cover costs such as outstanding utility bills, first and last month\u2019s rent and essential household items.More than 16,000 people in Ontario rely on the benefit every month, which receives about $120 million in funding.The benefit acts as a lifeline for people leaving abusive relationships, shelters or transition housing, explains Poole-Cotnam.In its place, about 50 per cent of the benefit\u2019s funding will now be shifted to municipalities for housing and homelessness programs.The cut not only affects people, but also social support programs such as the ones offered at the Centretown Community Health Centre.\u201cWe already struggle to help people access housing, as there is such a huge shortage; I can\u2019t imagine it being worse, but now I suppose it is,\u201d Lindsay Snow, community engagement worker at the centre stated in an email. Snow explained that without the benefit, more people will become homeless, especially in Centretown, and the clients she already sees will stay homeless. This is because municipalities will now only have half the funding to deal with the same problems.\u201cIt just worries me that the process for getting help will be very complicated and very restrictive and very time consuming and those things are huge barriers when people are trying to secure a place,\u201d said Snow.\u201cWe offer housing help here that is already busy and that will be doubled undoubtedly,\u201d said Snow.Not having the resources to help people in such desperate need will be very taxing on workers, Snow explained. Centretown resident George Upchurch uses the benefit to help pay for his utility bills and rent on Bronson Avenue. He is currently dealing with his landlord about a bedbug infestation and a broken door, which leaves him facing unbearable temperatures in the winter. \u201cI am going through so much stuff right now. My place needs a lot of fixing up and the cut will take that money away from me,\u201d Upchurch says. \u201cSometimes my (hydro) bill is $450 and in the winter I have to pay extra because of my door.\u201dThe Somerset West Community Health Centre is also concerned about the cut. On its website, it advertised an information session at about the cut, held at Patro d\u2019Ottawa on Oct. 11.Anti-poverty activists came out to inform the public about what implications the cut will have and how the benefit has helped thousands. Panellists, including Poole-Cotnam, encouraged the audience to join together in a province-wide movement to stop the benefit from being eliminated. The CCHC is trying a different approach. Instead of targeting the province directly, it has organized a letter-writing campaign aimed generating action by the City of Ottawa. \u201cThat way they know how important the Community Start-Up has been for people, what kind of things they have helped with.\u201d Snow says. \u201cAnd to make sure that continues.\u201d ",

    "body": "The convenience of living in Centretown has led to the second-highest increase in property values in the city, according to a new study. \r\rThe most recent Municipal Property Assessment Corporation showed Centretown properties increased in value by an average of 8.4 per cent, compared with an average increase of 6.3 per cent for the city as a whole. The new numbers will mean higher taxes in what is one of Ottawa\u2019s most desirable districts.People want to live downtown, says Ansel Clarke of the Ottawa Real Estate Board, so it\u2019s no surprise the value of properties in Centretown has increased more than most areas in Ottawa.\u201cProperty values have risen consistently across the city, Centretown being a more expensive area to begin with,\u201d Clarke says. \u201c(People) want to walk to the (National) Arts Centre, shopping, the museums, the galleries... It\u2019s a lifestyle choice.\u201dClarke adds that the city's plans for intensification also plays a role in MPAC\u2019s recent assessment, encouraging more people to live downtown and driving property values up.\u201cThe government would rather see infill projects and construction in the Centretown area where services are already available,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a lot more expensive to build, if you have to bring all the services to outlying areas. In Centretown, Clarke says, \u201cthe facilities, the amenities are already there.\u201dAlbert Galpin has lived in Centretown for more than 30 years and raised his family here. He agrees with Clarke and says people want to live in this neighbourhood because it\u2019s\u00a0 convenient. \u201cI can walk home from my office in about half an hour. I\u2019ve always walked,\u201d Galpin says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so important that kids be able to live in their neighbourhood and be able to walk to school.\u201dGalpin says he\u2019s seen a huge increase in his home\u2019s value over the past few years. Looking back to 2001, his monthly property taxes were around $300. Today, they\u2019ve more than doubled to about $700 a month. While Galpin and his wife were able to purchase a house in Centretown years ago, he says anyone looking to buy a first home in this area faces a huge burden because the prices continue to go up. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how people would be able to get into Centretown right now, if they were starting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be really tough.\u201dAnd these prices don\u2019t only affect people who want to move downtown. Clarke says those living on fixed income \u2013 pensioners, for example \u2013 will feel an impact as property taxes rise. Further, Ottawa is the only city in Ontario with a tax deferral program for seniors or people with disabilities to assist in their annual property tax payments. According to Ken Hughes, the City of Ottawa\u2019s deputy treasurer, there are about 100 residents using the program right now. Clarke also points out that anyone who\u2019s lived in Centretown for a number of years now has a nice asset they can cash in, if living downtown becomes too costly for homeowners..\u201cIt\u2019s a two-edged sword.\u201d \u201cIt may become more expensive to stay in your own home, but at the same time you do have a nice nest egg.\u201d But then, of course, they\u2019d no longer be living in the coveted Centretown area.

    "body": "Brad Clouthier, Centretown NewsNot everyone is thrilled with the introduction of double-decker buses on some busy downtown routes.  While some may be captivated by the look of Ottawa\u2019s new double-deckers, disability advocates worry that these buses may not be equipped for all riders.\r\rLast week, eight of 75 double-decker buses hit the streets for the first time, transporting people on express routes between downtown and places like Kanata, Orl\u00e9ans and Barrhaven. This latest addition to OC Transpo\u2019s fleet cost $72 million but is expected to lower operational costs while allowing up to 20 more commuters per bus, according to the transit service\u2019s website.But as the buses gradually enter regular routes, Catherine Gardner, a member of the city\u2019s accessibility advisory committee, is concerned for disabled riders, like herself.\u201cThe first seat is right across from the stairs,\u201d she says. \u201cSo what happens is, when you come to a stop, you have everyone coming down the stairs trying to get out the door, (and) you\u2019ve got the person with the disability trying to get out of their spot and you\u2019ve got people trying to get on.\u201d Currently, the buses only allow passengers to load from the front doors, so disabled and elderly commuters, or those with strollers, must walk to the middle of the bus in order to reach accessible seating.Still, David Pepper, manager of business and operational services at OC Transpo, wrote in an e-mail that the double-decker bus is \u201cfully compliant with regulations under the Access for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\u201d This act states that disability seating will be located as close as practicable to the entrances of vehicles. Pepper added that OC Transpo hosted an opportunity for the members of the city\u2019s accessibility advisory committee to view and board a double-decker bus.\u201cMembers of the committee were pleased with the available space for mobility devices and priority seating on the first level and offered recommendations regarding additional required directional signs for wheelchair position and the stairways,\u201d wrote Pepper, who added that these concerns were addressed before the buses were introduced last week.Bob Brown, a quadriplegic and chair of the subcommittee on accessible transportation, says he contributed to these recommendations. He recalled two of the main issues to be related to handles and stop buttons.He says disabled riders are not able to put their whole arm through the handle provided next to the accessibility seating and have to reach behind them in order to request a stop, which Brown would like to see changed.\u201cAll in all, I didn\u2019t see any major problems,\u201d says Brown. \u201cBut I think some chairs will have trouble. It\u2019s a little bit tighter making the corner off the ramp near the driver.\u201dThis may not be the only problem passengers may have when trying to get on and off the bus.Although only in its second day of operation, one bus experienced technical problems, which passenger Tristan Lee-Coughlin says prevented it from being able to lower its ramp.\u201cIt was something to do with the hydraulics,\u201d he said.Over the next few weeks, OC Transpo will be introducing double-decker buses to 10 more routes and anticipates all 75 of them will be in service by April 2013.",

    "body": "Heritage groups are criticizing what some see as a political takeover of the committee that advises city council on heritage issues. \r\rOttawa city council voted in late August to replace four of the seven public members of Ottawa Build heritage advisory committee with councillors, putting the remaining public members in the minority. The change in the committee was part of a restructuring of the city\u2019s advisory committees that saw 15 such groups cut to five. \u201cThis advisory committee is a useful opportunity for citizen input into heritage issues,\u201d says Leslie Maitland, president of the independent group Heritage Ottawa. \u201cIf the councillors outnumber the citizens it amounts to councillors providing information to councillors. There\u2019s a diminishing of public input.\u201dThe decision, which also changes the heritage committee\u2019s status to a sub-committee, was opposed by the committee itself prior to the decision. At a meeting in early September, the committee called on city council to keep a majority of public members. The members also discussed the possibility of resigning over the issue.Coun. Peter Hume, chairman of the planning committee, to which the new heritage sub-committee will report, declined to be interviewed about the issue. But in an earlier interview with the Ottawa Citizen he said that filling the committee with councillors is a way to make it more important. According to Maitland, however, the committee has recently clashed with councillors and city staff over projects including Lansdowne Park and the proposed demolition of heritage homes on Sussex Drive. \u201cThe councillors weren\u2019t appreciating how often they were on the same page. They only heard about the controversial issues,\u201d she says. \u201cI think they have the idea that if the councillors run this sub-committee, we won\u2019t have these controversies. But they are not going to go away.\u201dWith the new structure, Ottawa will be the only major municipality in Ontario with a majority of councillors on a heritage committee. According to Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport guidelines, municipal heritage committees are supposed to be made up \u201cprimarily of volunteer citizens,\u201d while one or two councillors can be added to \u201cmaintain lines of communication.\u201d Ministry spokesperson Denelle Balfour said in an email that the Ottawa decision isn\u2019t violating Ontario provincial law. \u201cUltimately, it is the decision of a municipal council to establish a committee and appoint its members,\u201d she wrote.The opportunity for city councils to choose councillors over members of the public is a concern to Roscoe Petkovic, president of Community Heritage Ontario, an umbrella organization for heritage committees in Ontario. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d he says. Petkovic says that, in a sense,\u00a0 \u201cit is frustrating that we don\u2019t have the legal tools to smack them on the wrist.\u201dHe fears a majority of councillors can lead to heritage issues not being prioritized in Ottawa.\u201cCitizens tend to look at life more personally and focus on the environment\u2019s impact on the quality of life,\u201d he says. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t tend to think like that.\u201d",

    "body": "The Ontario Municipal Benchmarking Index was released last week for the year 2011. The report was put together by several municipalities to measure and compare various cities\u2019 performances across the sphere of public services.\r\rIn a nutshell, Ottawa performs well compared with 16 other cities. This city has the second highest annual library use per capita, ranks second highest in the number of participants in sport and recreation programs, and ranks second highest for conventional transit trips.But the report also highlighted that Ottawa\u2019s public transportation system is the most expensive of all of the participating municipalities, costing a hefty $218 for one hour of service. By contrast, Toronto spends $180 for an hour of service. It might seem outrageous, at first glance, for the city to be spending such an amount on one hour of service for public transportation, especially when Toronto, with five times the population of Ottawa, is $38 an hour cheaper. However, much of the savings for Toronto are attributed to its subway system. Having multiple subway systems in Toronto means that there are many more riders on one train, with only one driver operating the trains. However, lacking a train system in Ottawa means that a different driver operates every bus and when you add up all the buses and all the drivers, the costs are astronomical. That\u2019s not to mention all the buses that go through the downtown core during rush hours to the faraway reaches of Barrhaven and Nepean. Coun. Marianne Wilkinson, chair of the transportation committee, says that Ottawa has about 500,000 residents inside the Greenbelt and 400,000 outside. This means that people are constantly commuting back and forth and without a train system running buses to transport everyone, it makes sense that it would be costly. It costs the city about $3.61 to provide one bus ride. This number is higher than Toronto, which stands at $2.84, but lower than other municipalities such as York region ($7.62) and Durham region ($5.75).\u00a0 What do these numbers attest to? Well, for one thing, they show that the more people there are in an area, the cheaper it is to provide transit. Secondly, they show the value of having a train system in the city. Toronto, with five times the population of Ottawa, is able to provide cheaper rides to its residents. Wilkinson says having the light-rail in Ottawa will certainly reduce costs in the long-term, but will be difficult initially, when the operating and construction costs have to be paid off. It makes sense, however, that we should expect to see savings from the light-rail system, as more people will be able to be transported to far-reaching places, and buses will likely travel shorter distances, with fewer drivers. It\u2019s easy to look at numbers and be outraged in the beginning, but numbers without a context have no meaning. When the numbers offered by OMBI are analyzed in their appropriate contexts, we can then determine whether the numbers make sense or not. It seems, in this instance, that the high costs of Ottawa\u2019s transit system make sense. ",

    "body": "A stroll through Centretown reveals all the usual mom and pop shops, urban grocers, and pub-grub restaurants that line Bank Street and give the neighbourhood its particular flair. But there seems to be something else hanging in the air, waywardly wafting like huge puffs of green mischief down the boulevard, just begging passersby to follow their nose. \r\rBongs and glass pipes line smokeshop windows and Canadian flags with red pot leaves hang from storefronts by granola grocers and herbal medicine shops. The only thing missing are the red-eyed, wayward stoners one would expect to find on the wrong end of a joint. Where are they?To pick through the seeds and stems of Centretown\u2019s seemingly not- so-secret stoner culture, one needs only to catch up with Filip Adonis and Daniel Lynch, employees at High Times on Cooper Street. The store sells everything from ashtrays and aluminum foil to bongs and bowls. Magazines and cookbooks rest on a shelf near the front, while do-it-yourself grow kits and different strains of seeds are available at the back. They even stock a choice of products that promise to mask the signs of cannabis on, say, a government urine test. A one-stop shop, to be sure. But, for who? \u201cYou\u2019d be shocked at the wide range of people that pop in here,\u201d Lynch tells me. \u201cThe bulk of our business comes from students and a lot of government workers. It\u2019s not always the people you\u2019d think.\u201d But the typical stoner stereotype persists; the young, tie-dye sporting hippy remains the image associated with marijuana use. \u201cPeople get the wrong impression because we call it a drug, so you\u2019re automatically bad for doing it. Like, you wouldn\u2019t want your mom knowing about it,\u201d Adonis says. \u201cCentretown\u2019s got a huge underground cannabis community. They\u2019re just good at keeping it quiet,\u201d he adds, ringing up a few customers, no ponchos or peace signs in sight. Earlier this year, the federal Liberal party voted to support the legalization of marijuana at its annual convention. Additionally, institutions such as the Hotchkiss Brain Institute in Alberta and Simon Fraser University are producing increasing amounts of research that show marijuana\u2019s myriad of medical uses, including treating pain or eating disorders. This is valuable work, but before pursuing such institutional change, let\u2019s\u00a0 first break the ingrained stereotypes many hold of marijuana users. Stu Baker and Cass Triska are university students living in Centretown and daily marijuana users. They say they recognize the social stigma associated with weed smoking, but don\u2019t buy into it much because they don\u2019t see themselves in the mold. \u201cThe stereotype that people associate with stoners, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s true,\u201d says Triska. \u201cLook at us, we all get up and go to school, have decent grades, jobs. We\u2019re functioning members of society, not a bunch of losers.\u201dDespite one too many boxes of Kraft Dinner, their house is in decent order; Baker\u2019s engineering homework laid out quietly next to a small handful of dope and an electric vaporizer. But despite their frequent use, neither Baker nor Triska could say exactly what the legal ramifications of pot use are. Since 1997, cannabis has been listed as a narcotic under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, nestled between heroin and hallucinogens such as LSD and magic mushrooms. Depending on how much one is holding during a run-in with the cops, a pot charge can bring anything from a small warning or fine to some prison time. But compared with legally regulated drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, marijuana sits significantly lower on the personal harm rung, at least according to a study conducted by the medical\u00a0 journal The Lancet in 2007. Marijuana also consistently accounts for zero annual deaths in Canada. Smokers such as Baker and Triska say they see sparking a joint as no different than cracking a beer or sipping a stiff drink at the end of a long day. \u201cIt\u2019s more just to relax and hang out once your work is done, have some deep chats with a friend then go to sleep,\u201d laughs Baker. \u201cNothing too crazy.\u201dOthers in the neighbourhood see marijuana\u2019s function as far exceeding a little rest and relaxation or some giggles. Former Centretown resident Clayton Goodwyn is a Canadian Forces veteran who uses cannabis to treat disabilities such as chronic pain and anxiety from his years in the forces. Unable to find a doctor willing to prescribe him medical marijuana, he buys from dealers but worries about the quality of what he\u2019s rolling up. In the past, he says he's tried prescription painkillers and anti-depressants but neither worked.\u201cI consider marijuana as a medication\u201d says as Goodwyn. \u201cWe\u2019re not bad people, we\u2019re not druggies. The people who need it as medicine should have it as medicine.\u201dBut to reach the point where people such as Goodwyn can easily access the medicine that works for them, or for students like Barker and Triska to breathe a bit easier, society needs to re-evaluate the way smokers are seen. The super stoner may be an understood exaggeration, but pot smokers still seem to be getting the wag of the finger rather than the old tip of the hat when it comes to public policy. The Harper government\u2019s controversial 2011 omnibus crime bill set mandatory minimum sentences for marijuana offenders carrying even minor amounts of weed, while superior and appellate courts in Ontario have repeatedly declared Canada\u2019s cannabis laws to be of no force or effect. We\u2019ve hit a crossroads where stereotypes and draconian legislation are standing in the way of legitimate social and medical progress. Before the legalization movement can get a foot in solid grass, and those who need it as medication can do so unrestricted, it\u2019s time to rethink the pothead pose and accept weed as something that\u2019s become increasingly interwoven into Canadian culture. When we begin to see marijuana smokers not as lazy, drug addicted societal dregs, but rather as the smiling faces of our neighbours, our legislation may start to reflect it as well. ",

    "body": "The euphoria surrounding Justin Trudeau\u2019s leadership bid has conveniently clouded what the Liberal Party has stood for the past 18 years \u2013 rigid austerity and corporate tax cuts.\r\rSo far, Trudeau has given no indication that he will move away from this path in his campaign to \u201crenew\u201d the party. In the last federal election, Canadians rewarded the Liberals with record low number of seats in the House of Commons. So, if Trudeau wants to take his party in a new direction, now would be a good time to fill the country in on some specifics. Charisma and slogans containing terms such as \u201cyouth\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d only go so far. Vancouver- based columnist and activist Murray Dobbin says that if Trudeau should do a comprehensive overhaul of his party\u2019s current policies. Among the changes Dobbin suggests are taxing the rich, increasing social spending, formulating a clear environmental policy and working with the NDP to unseat Stephen Harper. Taking a stance on these issues will consolidate a disillusioned base. \u201cTrudeau could get a lot of mileage from criticizing what his party has done to the country and pledging to reverse its course,\u201d Dobbins says, \u201cto re-establish the principles of governance that his father actually believed in.\u201dTrudeau could also stand up for human rights by denouncing the usage of \u201csecurity certificates,\u201d a mechanism used to deport non-citizens. Until a ruling by the Supreme Court in 2007 that\u00a0 the process of issuing of these certificates was unconstitutional, those pegged with these certificates couldn\u2019t see the evidence amassed against them.The Conservative government then introduced an amendment in 2008 that allows \u201cspecial lawyers,\u201d chosen by the justice minister, to only view \u201csummaries\u201d of the evidence. This amendment was supported by the Liberals. If Trudeau wants to blaze a new path and bring a new kind of politics to his party, this would be the place to start. It will certainly bring him respect and attention from minority communities such as the growing Muslim community, who have been disproportionately targeted. These are, of course, slow-moving changes. Nonetheless, Trudeau should commit to them in public. Doing so will rejuvenate dying support for his party, and perhaps even win over supporters from the New Democrats. The Liberals shifted to the right even in the years of Paul Martin, who boasted as finance minister that he cut government spending to a level comparable to the 1950s. Martin\u2019s aggressive leadership campaign and rivalry with Jean Chretien created huge schisms within the party. By crafting a defined set of policies, Trudeau can unite the party and establish a focus for the future. \u00a0Canadians are tired of wishy-washy leaders who, among other things, seemed to not know anything about what he actually wanted \u2013 or stood for. \u00a0\u00a0If Trudeau can break this spell by trying to steerr his party in a different direction, then the Liberal Party may have a shot at recapturing past successes.

But it\u2019s not enough.\u201dHe says that, so far, the theatre has only managed to raise half of the amount needed.Demarbre says the theatre has looked at all of its options and fundraising for the projector was the only realistic way of getting the money needed. He says the Mayfair isn\u2019t in a position to pay back a bank loan. He stresses he will have to close if he can\u2019t raise the money, because the theatre won\u2019t be able to survive only showing old movies on film.\u201cWe need to get the word out there so that more people attend the fundraisers. It\u2019s a little scary at this point,\u201d he says. \u201cThis morning I drove down to AMC to pick up a 35-mm film print, but I won\u2019t be able to do that in a couple of weeks because they\u2019re switching to digital before the end of next month.\u201dIn 2008, the Mayfair was declared an official heritage building by the City of Ottawa. It was built in 1932 during the depression and is one of the oldest surviving independent movie houses in Canada. The inside is made to look like a Mediterranean plaza. Two faux-balconies with clay-tile canopies line the sides, while two smaller balconies stand at the front.This year, on Dec. 2, the movie house is celebrating its 80th anniversary. Jay Baltz, who is on the board of Heritage Ottawa, says that the theatre, which serves all of downtown Ottawa, has a unique place in the city\u2019s culture because it is one of only two repertory theatres in the city. The other is the Bytowne Cinema on Rideau Street.\u201cThe Mayfair is very unique because it is heritage designated on the inside, while most buildings are considered heritage buildings because of their exterior.\u201d Baltz was chair of the local architectural advisory committee when the city decided on the building\u2019s heritage status. He says that strong interest in preserving the building came from the downtown community.Paz Blundell has been going to the Mayfair for 30 years. He now owns Framed, a custom framing store straight across from the theatre.His business has tried to step up and help the theatre. It custom-framed the vintage, first-release posters the Mayfair auctioned off at one of its fundraisers.\u201cI think the Mayfair is a big part of the fabric of the community, not just of Old Ottawa South, but the whole city,\u201d says Blundell.",

    "body": "Midnight\u2019s Children, the film adaptation of Salman Rushdie\u2019s prize-winning novel of the same name, premiered in Ottawa this week. The story chronicles the lives of one family from India\u2019s independence in 1947 until the 1980s. \r\rThe film, adapted for the screen by Indian-Canadian director Deepa Mehta, premiered in Ottawa as part of the Ottawa International Writer\u2019s Festival. Mehta attended the premier and took part in a Q&A about the film. Tickets for the movie\u2019s Ottawa premiere sold out so quickly that the festival had to add an earlier screening so that more people could see the film. The premiere\u2019s success owes much to the wide appeal of Rushdie\u2019s novel, which is generally considered his best work. But Rushdie\u2019s fans\u2019 motives might not be entirely magnanimous. Translating a book to film is a tricky craft and there\u2019s a certain schadenfreude in seeing a beloved book mishandled by Hollywood.Take, for example, the Harry Potter films. The acting in Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone is so wooden and the narrative so condensed that the movie is almost unwatchable. The movie\u2019s greatest delight is as a vehicle for derision. But Mehta is no Chris Columbus. Her Fire, Earth and Water trilogy was nominated for two Academy Awards and she has proven herself a superb filmmaker with a lush visual style. Then there\u2019s Rushdie, who not only gave her adaptation his blessing, but also helped her write the screenplay. Midnight\u2019s Children, arguably his best novel, is a classic example of magical realism and also a classic example of Rushdie\u2019s enigmatic, witty and erudite prose. Without his voice, the film would be a pale reflection of his richly textured world.Rushdie may be able to infuse the screenplay for Midnight\u2019s Children with his characteristic wit. But it\u2019s a fine line between faithfulness to an author\u2019s vision and preciousness with the text. It seems sacrilegious to compare J.K. Rowling\u2019s fantasy series to Rushdie\u2019s Nobel-Prize winning oeuvre but the analogy is not entirely meaningless.Rowling was heavily involved with the film adaptations, much like Rushdie\u2019s involvement with Midnight\u2019s Children.While the Harry Potter films were faithful to the minutiae of Rowling\u2019s universe, they failed to capture the magic (pun intended) of reading her series. The biggest problem with adapting a book to film is that no matter how closely a film captures the author\u2019s intentions, it very rarely captures the book\u2019s multitude of meanings for its many readers.Reading is a messy and intensely personal act. I reread passages over and over; I skip others; I flip back and forth between pages. No matter how tight the narrative, I unravel it and reconstruct it at will. The joy of reading is not submitting myself to an author\u2019s vision but recreating it for myself. Film watching, on the other hand, is almost always a communal and a much more passive act. We sit in a theatre with other people, held captive by the flickering screen. We may talk about the movie over coffee afterwards but by then the images may already be fading from our minds. It involves more recall than rewrite. For Mehta and Rushdie, the auteurs behind the film Midnight\u2019s Children, narrative control might be a blessing. But for readers of Rushdie\u2019s work, who\u2019ve spent days, months and years building and destroying the novel\u2019s world in their minds, relinquishing this power will always come at a price.

He explains the exhibit arrives in a timely year for indigenous prophecies: 2012 marks the anniversary of the War of 1812, from which important native leaders emerged, and the year of the Mayan-predicted doomsday. Reminders of these moments, fused with themes such as indigenous-settler relationships and the effects of the capitalist economic system, inform the exhibit\u2019s various artworks, says Miner. Among the pieces to be shown are relief prints carved on canoe paddles and a series of outdoor fireplaces. Such works examine indigenous migrations and the importance of fire in teachings, Miner says.Laura Margita, director of Gallery 101, says Miner will be the most recent in a series of artists who have used the gallery to explore aboriginal issues through art. For about six years, the not-for-profit, artist-run gallery \u2013 located upstairs at 1-301\u00bd Bank Street, across from the Hartman\u2019s grocery \u2013 has maintained a focus on indigenous programming.\u201cFor a long time, artist-run centres have known, like the rest of Canada, that there\u2019s been vast inequities between the dominant culture and the aboriginal culture,\u201d Margita says.By creating a space for indigenous artists like Miner to display their work, Gallery 101 is working to reduce those inequities, she says.Earlier this year, the gallery hosted events for the Asinabka Festival that focused on indigenous media and arts.The Asinabka festival aimed to show \u201ca continual presence\u201d of the native community in Ottawa, and create \u201ca permanent forum\u201d for art and expression, says Christopher Wong, co-director of the festival. Much like Miner\u2019s show, the Asinabka Festival found inspiration in historical Native American leaders.Wong recalls Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief who led a unified, aboriginal rebellion in the U.S., and whose alliance with British and Canadian forces was key to thwarting a U.S. invasion during the War of 1812. Tecumseh is widely seen as a symbol of aboriginal resistance to the American government\u2019s violent displacement of native communities and the imposition of Eurocentric notions about land ownership.\u201cWith Asinabka, we wanted to revisit that idea that this space doesn\u2019t just belong to one person, or one nation or one culture, it\u2019s here for free for everybody . . . to enjoy and share ideas,\u201d Wong says.Miner says he hopes visitors will find new perspectives in Waasawaabaaminaa/Prophecies.From his selection of diverse media to the indigenous take on historical themes, Miner says he anticipates the exhibit will promote critical thinking on the issues he presents.",

They are rehearsing Cinderella for Opera Lyra's upcoming production of the classic fairytale. After a difficult year, Opera Lyra\u2019s new season of intimate community performances and grand opera is breathing new life into the struggling company. \r\rLast winter, Opera Lyra cancelled its final two productions of the year because of growing debt and disappointing ticket sales from the season\u2019s first production. Adding to its woes, was the disappearance of $11,000 from its coffers. But after help from the National Arts Centre and other funders, Opera Lyra is back and better than before with its 2012-2013 season.\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that they will have a long life in the future,\u201d says Rosemary Thompson, a spokesperson for the National Arts Centre.Taking over Opera Lyra\u2019s box office functions is one of many things the NAC has agreed to do in order to help Ottawa\u2019s only opera company find its way out of financial difficulties. \u00a0Jeep Jeffries, the new general director of Opera Lyra, says they chose two of the ten most popular and frequently produced operas, La Boh\u00e8me and La Traviata, for this year\u2019s main stage productions. Opening with a classic at the NAC, La Boh\u00e8me was well reviewed, but more significantly, the show was wildly successful in terms of ticket sales. \u201cOne of our shows is on a Monday, which is always a tough sell,\u201d Jeffries says. But he boasts that on average they sold 85 per cent of Southam Hall\u2019s 2,323 seats. The final performance was completely sold out. Jeffries says the turnout at La Boh\u00e8me was up 20 per cent from last year, with ticket sales rivalling some of Opera Lyra\u2019s best years. For this season, the second main stage production, La Traviata, will be done only as a concert version. \u201cThat means no scenery, limited costumes, no props and perhaps a bit of fancy lighting,\" Jeffires says.\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal cheaper than it would be if we were doing a normal production.\u201dThis will allow Opera Lyra to put on a full season while still watching its expenses. If its finances continue to improve, the company hopes to have two full main-stage productions in the 2013-2014 season. Jeffries says he hopes one day to offer three main stage productions in a season. Jeffries says he hopes that introducing a new, younger audience to the capital\u2019s opera scene will also help with the recovery process. Cinderella will tour schools in the Ottawa area in addition to its five public performances at the Arts Court Theatre Nov. 3-9. \u201cSeeing a very charming and funny performance of Cinderella might make you think that would be a pretty fun thing to do later in life,\u201d Jeffries says, eager to spread his own passion for opera.The one-hour adaptation of Gioachino Rossini\u2019s La Cenerentola will follow the story we all know and love, with slight variations. Jeffries says he wants students to experience a more \u201cintimate and friendly environment.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really nice that they\u2019re able to book the theatre space here,\u201d says Arts Court Coordinator, Monique Lachapelle. \u201cAnd to give the community an opportunity to access an opera.\u201d With a successful production under its belt and a new one opening next month, Opera Lyra Ottawa is much closer to Cinderella\u2019s happily-ever-after than they were this time last year.\u201cWe are not entirely out of the woods now, but good progress has been made,\u201d Jeffries says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd we\u2019ll continue to make good progress, I think.\u201d",

The festival will showcase music, theatre, dance, visual arts, film, food, fashion and more at various venues across the city.\u201cWe started out with consultations with community leaders in Nunavut to find out what we could do that would really address the needs of the community,\u201d says Genevieve Cimon, the NAC\u2019s director of music education.From these consultations, the Year of the North was born: a blend of classical European music and classical Inuit music. Grammy-winning Canadian violinist James Ehnes will be performing as the featured soloist in Vivaldi\u2019s The Four Seasons during the tour.\u201cAs far as what the musical traditions are for the people of the North, other than throat singing, I don\u2019t know much about it, so I think these educational opportunities, they\u2019re probably going to be more for me than for them,\u201d he says.A throat-singing piece composed by school children from Ottawa and Iqaluit is one of the Inuit pieces in the tour\u2019s repertoire. Nancy Mike, an Inuit throat singer, taught the children of Hillcrest High School and Inuksuk High School to throat sing. Mike says she originally learned throat singing through a workshop and says she is happy to be able to give this opportunity to a new generation. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun because these young people love to learn about their culture and from my perspective,\u201d she says.\u201cThey don\u2019t get that opportunity from their parents. They don\u2019t get to learn it from them, because their parents\u2019 generation was that generation that was told not to practice those things anymore.\u201dIn the early and mid-20th century, government and religious organizations attempted to assimilate the Inuit into the Canadian, Christian majority.Another major arts and culture issue in Nunavut is simply finding a place to perform, Mike says.

Had they stayed, \u201cthen creative jobs would come to fruition and more competition could arise,\u201d says Vicente.The name Herd \u201crepresents the gathering of creative people,\u201d says Vicente. \u201cIf creative minds gather the creative community can thrive.

In light of Breast Cancer Awareness month, Unshaven Mavens is taking a different approach to awareness of the disease by not shaving their armpits to raise money for the cause geared towards a younger audience. \r\rUnshaven Mavens is a month-long charity campaign of \u201cwomen who are knowledgeable about spreading awareness of early detection . . . for breast cancer,\u201d says Malorie Bertrand, co-founder of Unshaven Mavens. If the under arm-area is swollen, it could mean that the lymph nodes are swelling due to a virus.\u201cThe earlier you detect, the better your chances of survival,\u201d says Aime Beausoleil, co-founder, while attending the campaign\u2019s second \u201cpit-stop\u201d this month.Unshaven Mavens' second of three \u201cpit-stops\u201d took place on earlier this month at the Standard Luxury Tavern on Elgin Street.

It\u2019s also a time to take progress pictures of the growth of their armpit hair. By the two-week mark, the pictures start getting really hairy, jokes Beausoleil.Unshaven Mavens began officially last year after being inspired by other hair-growing campaigns like Movember. \u201cIt began as a joke . . . but we noticed an appetite for it,\u201d says Beausoleil.While there are many fundraisers that exist for cancer awareness, Unshaven Mavens takes a humorous, self-deprecating and preventative approach to help draw in a younger crowd. \u201cRethink Breast Cancer\u2019s whole purpose is to target women under 40 to give them the tools they need for early detection, prevention, and healthy living,\u201d says Bertrand. Rethink Breast Cancer is about \u201cbringing sass and style to the cause in order to engage a younger demographic and remind women to think about their breasts,\u201d says Nikki Byrne, manager of Rethink Breast Cancer.\u00a0\u201cOur goal is to raise awareness and create messaging that speaks loud and clear.\u201dWomen are encouraged to make a team of five or six women who are willing to toss aside beauty norms and grow their pit-hair for a good cause. Supporters can donate online at www.unshavenmavens.ca and at events. All proceeds go to Live, Laugh, Learn, a ladies night out for women diagnosed with breast cancer. Unshaven Mavens currently has plans to expand to larger metro cities such as Montreal and Toronto, where Rethink Cancer is located.

Today\u2019s youth \u2013 dubbed \u2018Generation Flux\u2019 by the Vital Youth report released earlier this month \u2013 are overeducated and underemployed, according to the report. \r\r\u201cIt\u2019s the engineer working in the burger stop,\u201d said Ian Bird, president and CEO of Community Foundations of Canada, the company behind the report. One third of 25- to 29-year-olds are working jobs below their skill level, according to the report, and delaying landmarks like leaving home to begin a family and a career.This new life trajectory is prominent in areas like Centretown, Bird says, where the proximity of two universities means the youth there are generally highly educated.Yan Cho works part-time at Elegant Style, a Bank Street boutique, while studying business, economics, and finance at the University of Ottawa. She says she hopes the combination of education and experience will help land her a dream job in the future.But nothing is guaranteed. \u201cI have a friend who graduated last summer, and she couldn\u2019t find a job,\u201d Cho said, adding that the friend\u2019s refusal to settle something below the government job she trained for has left her unemployed. It\u2019s not just government jobs that are hard to come by. Big-box chain Target plans to take over Zellers in March, and is firing all Zellers staff. They have the option to re-apply, but one Ottawa employee has other plans after hearing about his friends\u2019 fruitless job hunts. \u201cI plan on moving out west before the takeover,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s lots of work opportunity there.\u201dHe spoke on the condition of anonymity, as Zellers employees are forbidden to speak to the media. The 2009 recession is part of what makes finding work so difficult. Fifty per cent of jobs lost belonged to young workers, says Bird. Canadians between the ages of 15 and 24 still face a 15 per cent unemployment rates. This rate has remained steady, and the youth demographic is now the only one that hasn\u2019t recovered from the recession.Older workers putting off retirement after the recession only adds to the difficulty of finding a good job. Young workers are frozen in low-level jobs, and miss out on valuable work and career experience. The situation, he says, has the federal government wondering whether or not Generation Flux will be able to take over when the baby boomers eventually retire. \u201cThe big question the feds are asking,\u201d he says, \u201cis will they be ready?\u201dBut it isn\u2019t all doom, defeat, and despair. The young Aboriginal and newcomer population is one of the fastest-growing demographics, says Bird. If the government can help get them into the workforce through both new and old policies, and more job-specific training, unemployment rates will drop. Bird warns of severe consequences if the rates remain stagnant. \u201cWe risk having a generation disengaging from their communities,\u201d Bird says.When young people aren\u2019t engaged in their communities, they\u2019re less likely to spend their time and money in them, Bird says. They\u2019re less likely to support local businesses or organizations. Cho, however, remains optimistic. Things look bad now, she says, but the future is unknown.",

    "body": "High levels of youth unemployment and the serious threat of environmental disaster are contributing to a sense of malaise among young people today. It\u2019s time for Ottawa to address these problems by developing a green economy that will not only employ youth, but also mitigate the worst effects of global climate change. \r\rA good place to start would be green retrofits for homes. These renovations make homes more energy-efficient, lower heating bills, and create jobs while reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. A June report by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives argues that \u201cbuilding retrofits are the low-hanging fruit of green job development,\u201d since a great number off homes remain far from the \u201czero-emissions\u201d goal we should be aiming for. But earlier this year, Ottawa axed ecoENERGY Retrofit, a popular program that helped homeowners make their homes more energy-efficient with grants of up to $5,000. Neither the provincial nor municipal government offer anything to fill the gap. The retrofits saved more than 1.8 million megatonnes of greenhouse gases in its initial phase, according to a statement on the website of Vic Toews, the minister of public safety, who called for the program\u2019s renewal last year. The program also created jobs by stimulating demand for renovations, which means more opportunities for businesses specializing in green building. This kind of program is by no means a panacea. As the CCPA argues, such measures need to happen in tandem with skills-training programs aimed at disadvantaged groups. A boom in energy-efficient renovations should benefit young people, aboriginal people, and immigrants who are among those struggling to find well-paying and meaningful work. Ottawa should work with provinces and territories on apprenticeship programs that help youth develop skills in green renovation and other environmentally-focused industries. The House of Commons\u2019 Standing Committee on Human Resources is currently studying ways to improve apprenticeship programs, to get more young people involved in the trades. But the green economy is not on the agenda. At the same time, Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s government is investing a fortune in the environmentally destructive fossil fuel industry. A study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development found that Ottawa was providing nearly $1.4 billion in tax breaks and other subsidies to the oil industry in 2009.Meanwhile, youth from a coalition of environmental groups called PowerShift Canada are calling for Harper to invest in green jobs. Maybe it\u2019s time that he listen. These youth point out that oil subsidies support some of the most unsustainable activities on the planet. Indeed, oil and gas facilities produce one-third of the carbon dioxide emissions in the country, according to data from the CCPA. But these industries also frequently offer high-paying, unionized jobs that workers don\u2019t want to lose. And huge investment in the Athabasca tar-sands means that oil appears to be the new engine of economic growth in Canada. The challenge is to create an economy based on green jobs and policies such as the promotion of green renovation would be a step in the right direction. But the federal government is going backwards. Without a major investment in green jobs, the Harper government threatens to leave the young generation with a legacy of environmental calamity, and in the meantime, joblessness. ",

    "body": "Amanda Stephen, Centretown NewsBartender Courtney Cochrane collects her tips at Brixton's Pub. The Sparks Street bar has publicly supported a proposed bill to regulate tip distribution. Servers in Ottawa are pinning their hopes on a bill that could prevent management from taking part of their tips.\r\rRestaurants, banquet halls and bars across Ontario are allowed to collect a percentage of servers\u2019 tips, a practice known as \u201ctipping out,\u201d under Ontario\u2019s current Employment Standards Act. This percentage usually goes towards support staff such as busboys, cooks and hosts, who do not collect tips, but owners are increasingly taking a cut as well.\u201cWhen people eat at the restaurant and leave a 15-per-cent tip, they feel like they\u2019re paying for the service, not the food,\u201d says Vadim Malinowski, a server at the Ottawa Convention Centre. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that part of that 15 per cent ends up in the hands of the owner as well.\u201dIn a business in which most people earn minimum wage, tipping out to staff is a common practice, but tipping out to owners is a recent development. A report in the Toronto Star attributes the rise of this new practice to a sluggish economy, as well as a legislated 65-cent wage increase for liquor and restaurant workers implemented in 2010.\u201cTheft is what it is,\u201d says Paul Hinger, a representative for convention centre workers. \u201cOwners already cover their labour costs with the bill and make a big profit. That they would take a percentage of the tips on top of that is downright criminal.\u201dFor Hinger, paying management part of customers\u2019 tips is akin to paying to be able to work.Malinovski, Hinger and other workers from the convention centre were invited earlier this month to meet with Ontario NDP MPP Michael Prue during his visit in Ottawa. Prue, the NDP finance critic, met with supporters at Brixton\u2019s Pub to discuss tipping out practices.Last June, Prue introduced a private members bill, Bill 107, to prevent owners from abusing current tipping regulations.\u201cWhile other people are trying to overhaul the Employment Standards Act, my bill is just one line long,\u201d says Prue. The proposed law simply states that \u201can employer shall not take any portion of an employee\u2019s tips or other gratuities.\u201dPrue\u2019s interest in the issue came about when a constituent in his Beaches-East York riding, who worked as a server, complained to him about the matter. After investigation, he found tipping out to be a widespread practice within the Ontario service industry, and a completely unregulated one. Under the current legislation, employers can legally collect 100 per cent of their server\u2019s tips. The government only requires that the money be declared for income tax purposes.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re actively trying to raise awareness about this issue so people can know this is going on,\u201d says Prue. \u201cWe have a minority government right now, so we have the chance to give these workers the protection they deserve.\u201dSo far, Prue claims the bill has drawn support from both Liberals and Progressive Conservatives, but whether the bill will be reintroduced when the Ontario legislature reconvenes remains to be seen.",

But Bill 74 died when Premier Dalton McGuinty prorogued the legislature.\u201cI will bring it back but it is uncertain how and when this could happen,\u201d says NDP France G\u00e9linas, the MPP who championed the bill.The proposed ban has been debated for a number of years because of an International Agency for Research on Cancer report suggesting that using a tanning bed before the age of 35 can increase the risk of skin cancer by as much as 75 per cent.But salon owners say responsible tanning decreases this risk. Since there are no standards ensuring the practice of safe tanning, there is little to prevent equipment operators from over exposing customers.\u201cThe real problem is that there are no regulations in the tanning industry in Canada,\u201d says Andy Boznar, owner of UTan on King Edward Avenue.\u201cI always ask for parental consent from teenagers.\u201dThe Joint Canadian Tanning Association is calling for provincial standards on training procedures instead of an age restriction.They want to see their association's guidelines standardized, including having a certified operator control the equipment and barring customers with skin too fair to tan safely.The society\u2019s executive director, Steven Gilroy, says his organization has been working with the Ontario government to develop professional standards for 18 months. \u201cWe can only hope the government understands the risks about who controls the equipment,\u201d Gilroy says.The association disputes the claims of risk\u00a0 by OPH and argues the percentage of people who could suffer health issues as a result of tanning is almost zero, if tanned by responsible operators.Ottawa Public Health still supports a ban.\u201cWe have recommended to the Board of Health, the group who governs our services, to send letters of support for legislation on indoor tanning to both the provincial and federal governments,\u201d says Ottawa Public Health nurse Diane Desjardins. \u201cWe\u2019re following in the footsteps of other health units and advocating for legislation because we know that education and awareness alone will not decrease this trend.\u201d ",

Standing on his porch, Hung says he can already hear a lot of noise coming from the church during operating hours. With the new expansion, he says he will also have a large wall to stare at two metres from the side of his porch, and the new sloped roof dropping snow into his yard during the winter is a worry. A 25-spot underground parking garage that will be built underneath the expansion is meant to help alleviate some of the Parking issues.Connie Brian, who lives across the street from the proposed site, says parking on the narrow Bell Street North is already terrible and a garage that can only be used by the church\u2019s parishioners won\u2019t help the situation.Eric Darwin, president of the Dalhousie Community Association, says the purchase of 50 and 54 Bell St. N. for the expansion of the Chinese Alliance Church into a mega-church may be cheaper in the short-run, but in the long-run it will be inconvenient both for neighbours and for parishioners. \u201cIf you are putting in a church that has a region-wide draw, it should be located on a major arterial, or in an industrial park, or in the sort of place where you can get a large number of people coming and going by car, driving in, parking, and leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cThe local streets are no longer local streets, they become streets that people want to zoom in or zoom out when church service is over.\u201dDespite neighbours\u2019 worries, Rev. Gerald Chan, the church\u2019s senior pastor, says the expansion will not inconvenience residents .Chan says that after some consultation with his future neighbours on Bell Street, they decided not to allow any access to the church through the side of the expansion facing Bell Street, easing the worries of neighbours.\u201cWe understand the concerns, and we have addressed them by not allowing any access from Bell Street,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the traffic will be coming from Eccles, same as now. The cars will be coming into our underground parking through our parking lot on Eccles.\u201d But Darwin, Hung, and Brian all agree that combined with past development in their neighbourhood, the Chinese Alliance Church\u2019s expansion onto Bell Street is one more piece of the puzzle that will eventually change their neighbourhood from residential to institutional in nature.",

It will be hosted from Nov. 1-4 at the Library and Archives of Ottawa and despite its founder\u2019s political affiliation, it doesn\u2019t cater to conservative thinkers.\r\rThe festival, organized by the Free Thinking Film Society, will include film screenings and book launches addressed by speakers such as Pierre Desrochers and Martin Gladstone. Fred Litwin, founder of the festival, says he created the society to show films in Ottawa that no one else was willing to show. Most of the films are considered right-wing because he thought this perspective was missing in the films being shown in the city. The festival garnered a lot of attention last year when the host decided to cancel the screening of the polemic documentary Iranium. When the screening finally happened a few months later, the audience had grown. It continued to grow at the subsequent events held by Litwin. \u201cIranium was fantastic publicity for us,\u201d\u00a0says Litwin.Matt Bufton attended the second edition of the festival. \u201cIt makes sense in a city like Ottawa where a lot of people are interested in politics that there is a demand for that kind of festival,\u201d he says.Many of the films this year will be Canadian premieres, covering topics such as human rights violations in China and the tyrannical North Korean regime.\u201cThe topics may be controversial but they are very important,\u201d Litwin says. \u201cThere could be protests again this year, I\u2019m in favour of free speech so I encourage people who have a problem with the initiative or the films to come talk to me about it.\u201dHe says he is a conservative but it doesn't mean the festival is. \u201cThe films all promote liberty and democracy and I believe that these values are not only conservative values,\u201d he says.The films received good reviews in major publications and some were even presented in the Sundance Film Festival.Bufton says they deserve to be seen regardless of political point of view. \u201cFor those looking at it as a conservative or libertarian festival, just go and try to look for things where maybe there is a common cause, there is a common interest that spreads across ideological camp that you were not aware of.\u201d",

Users can also send in feedback or gain access to the district\u2019s social media pages.The app can be navigated through tabs at the bottom which are labelled by category. For example, clicking on the Buses tab shows a list of schools whose buses have been delayed, how many minutes they have been delayed by, and whether they are the buses going to school or from school. Jennifer Adams, the board\u2019s director of education, explained in a press release that the app is a natural next step in communicating with those involved in the education system. \u201cWe are constantly seeking new ways to ensure our students, staff and community members are informed and engaged,\u201d she added.Some, however, have been left out of the loop. Kelly Mills, an office administrator at Featherstone Elementary School, says she found the app useful and relevant. Many of her colleagues have made use of the app after hearing about it from her, but only those with iPhones can download it. Those with Android or Blackberry phones, she says, are missing out.Although the same information can be accessed on computers or other smart phones through the OCDSB website, Mills finds the app to be more convenient. It would be great if all staff could access it, she says.Many at Lisgar Collegiate Institute have the same problem. Vice-principal Bruce Summers says the majority of administration staff at his school has Android phones. But he isn\u2019t worried about the inaccessibility, he adds, because developing an Android app is a natural progression for the school district.Currently, however, there is no Android app in development, explains Lauren Peddle, communications co-ordinator for the school board. Though the school district aims to make the app accessible to all, future development depends on the current app\u2019s success and on funding. \u201cIf the app is successful, we hope to move on to other devices,\u201d Peddle says.In the first two weeks after the app\u2019s release, more than 700 people downloaded it. This number reflects an even mix of students, staff, and parents, explains Peddle. \u201cStaff members are seeing the usefulness of it, but students see the functionality of it as well.\u201dOfficials say the app has also received community support and feedback. One such community member is John Marshall. With two children in the OCDSB school system and one just graduated, Marshall says he was eager to try the app. \u201cI have found that communication from the (school board) has been a bit spotty at times,\u201d he says, adding the website can be hard to navigate and slow to be updated. \u201cThis app is a big improvement from the communications perspective. It\u2019s clean, intuitive, and seems to be updated as close to real time as can be expected.\u201dTaking the feedback into account, the school district plans to release an improved version within the next few weeks.

    "body": "Courtesy Tatiana RotherThe Canadian men's street soccer team placed third in the Community Cup after Ottawa Street Soccer player Ephrame Mehari scored the winning goal in a penalty shootout against the United States.  A new generation of sporting heroes took to the pitch earlier this month as street soccer players from across the globe descended on Mexico City for the 10th annual Homeless World Cup. \r\rThe Canadian men's street soccer team, which featured Ottawa Street Soccer player Ephrame Mehari, was one of 43 teams in the tournament \u2013 in addition to 13 women's teams.Street soccer is all about social inclusion through sport, says Tatiana Rother, a Lisgar Collegiate graduate and founder of Ottawa Street Soccer. \u201cTypically for homeless people you have a lot of negative stereotypes, you don\u2019t think of them as athletes,\u201d she says. \u201cWe try to break down barriers and the idea that playing a sport can change people\u2019s lives.\u201dThe sport includes players from shelters, recovery programs and people with mental health problem.Alongside Mehari, Rother travelled to Mexico to be part of the 2012 Homeless World Cup with Street Soccer Canada. Although it\u2019s a serious competition, Street Soccer Canada has shown that it\u2019s not all about the results on the pitch. While other nations pick out the most skillful of players, Canada takes a slightly different approach. \u201cSome of the countries pick their top players. The people at Street Soccer Canada believe in choosing not necessarily the best skill level, but the people they think it\u2019ll help their lives the most in this moment,\u201d says Rother. \u201cThey try to pick people who are on the way to more positive things in their life and give them this opportunity, which we hope will jump start whatever they want to do next.\u201dDave Ro is the manager of St. Joe\u2019s Supper Table, a supporter of Ottawa Street Soccer.\u201cIt\u2019s a team environment. It brings a lot of people together, especially when people are homeless and worried about how they\u2019re going to survive,\u201d he says.The Canadian men\u2019s team placed 35th and came in third place in the Community Cup \u2013 a sub-tournament of the World Cup, while the women\u2019s team placed 12th, according to Rother. The results shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise, considering most of the players only met at the airport enroute to Mexico. \u201cThe people from the East Coast, most of us met the night before we flew out and then the people from the West Coast we met at the airport,\u201d says Rother. \u201cBecause Canada\u2019s such a big country you don\u2019t really get the chance to train with your team beforehand which can be a bit of a disadvantage.\u201dThe highlight of the tournament was a Canadian victory in penalties over the United States for third place in the Community Cup. It came down to Mehari to slot home the winner. \u201cI feel proud playing for Canada, because I never had this chance before,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially when you represent your country and you go out on the field. You feel something when you hear the national anthem.\u201dAlthough they didn\u2019t win, the crowds in Mexico appreciated the Canadian soccer skills. Some even went as far as asking for photos and autographs for keepsakes from the tournament. \u201cIt was funny because all the players and managers had these tags with your photo and your country and the locals would come up and ask for your autograph and for photos with you,\u201d says Rother. \u201cFor the players I think it gave them a sense of pride for their country.\u201d ",

    "body": "The debates are over, the \u201cFriends\u201d are gone, and the shovel is finally in the ground at Lansdowne Park.\r\rAfter years of nonsensical lawsuits and delays, city council approved the multi-million dollar redevelopment of Lansdowne Park earlier this month, meaning the Canadian Football League is officially on its way back to the nation\u2019s capital.If all goes to plan, Ottawa\u2019s third edition of a professional football team will be in action by 2014 \u2013 and it will have a fancy, refurbished Frank Clair Stadium to call home.While this is all good news, a lot needs to be done between now and then to ensure a seamless transition back into the league. Starting from scratch isn\u2019t easy.Finding a general manager, a head coach and some players would be a good start.And, of course, every team needs a name. Like the Ottawa Rough Riders and Renegades of the past, a name that starts with the letter \u201cR\u201d has appeal, the team\u2019s partowner Jeff Hunt told the Ottawa Sun earlier this month. Preserving some of the team\u2019s history and old look are important.That\u2019s one of many reasons why the Ottawa Rivermen should get serious consideration.It ties in with the region\u2019s logging heritage and embraces one of Ottawa\u2019s most prestigious landmarks: the Rideau Canal, which uses sections of the Rideau and Cataraqui rivers. As defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a \u201criverman\u201d is \u201cone who lives and works on or along a river.\u201dIn a sense, Ottawa\u2019s CFL team will \"live\" and \"work\" at Lansdowne, which is, coincidentally, a mere skip and hop away from the canal.Already, the canal features prominently in almost every photo taken of the stadium. By naming the team the Rivermen, the marketing possibilities become endless: How about having the team travel to the stadium via speedboat, a la David Beckham?It may not be a requirement for team names to have any sort of connection to the region in which it plays, but if there\u2019s an obvious opportunity to make the link, then it would be silly not to take it. And aside from the American Hockey League\u2019s Peoria Rivermen, it\u2019s a name no other professional sports team uses. The Rivermen is only one of several options that have been explored in recent weeks (some better than others). A majority of fans want to see a return of the Rough Riders, the team\u2019s first-ever name, according to a survey conducted by the Ottawa Sun. Of course, this is not to be confused with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, a current CFL team. Not so fast. In any league, let alone one that features just nine teams, having two almost identical team names would be downright foolish. And both Hunt and league commissioner Mark Cohon have spoken out against the idea publicly. \u00a0So we can scratch that off the list. Most recently, a campaign to name the team the Highlanders, inspired from Ottawa\u2019s official regiment the Cameron Highlanders, has been gaining steam. This is largely a result of a snazzy looking logo and concept released by local design company Le Collectif. It seems most of the support surrounding the campaign stems from their designs (which are certainly eye-catching), rather than the name itself. While the attractiveness of their proposed concept is hard to ignore, it shouldn\u2019t be the reason for choosing a team name. There\u2019s more to it than that. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about building a brand.\u00a0It\u2019s about getting people behind the team \u2013 the people who may not otherwise give a hoot about football. The hardcore fan will be there regardless. The casual fan may need some convincing.Aside from the political circles of the city, Ottawa is defined largely by its cultural (not military) heritage. It\u2019s something residents are proud of. Let\u2019s give them a CFL team they can be proud of, too.In 2014, let\u2019s give them the Ottawa Rivermen. ",

Darwin says early conceptualizations of the bikeway emerged at the perfect time, as support for improved cycling measures was growing exponentially.The enthusiasm for new infrastructure remains strong and this year\u2019s municipal budget includes $12.1 million to invest in cycling initiatives over the next three years, according to budget summaries. New developments such as the bikeway, which will cross the downtown core from Westboro to Vanier, aim to provide cyclists with safe but also healthier ways of cutting across downtown Ottawa. The proposed cycling route is expected to span more than 12 kilometres along Scott and Albert streets, and Laurier Avenue before crossing the Rideau Canal and the Golden Triangle. Cyclists will cross the Rideau River at St. Patrick Street and Beechwood Avenue before travelling along Hemlock Road to St. Laurent Boulevard. The health benefits of regular physical activity are part of the attraction for novice cyclists, says cycling advocate Alex deVries.DeVries is the vice-president of Citizens for Safe Cycling, a local organization that has been working for almost three decades to promote cycling as an alternative to motorized transportation. \u201cSome are concerned that the increased risk of injury from collisions makes cycling unsafe, but the health benefits far exceed the risks,\u201d says deVries.The risk of injury to cyclists is minimized by the route design and the new infrastructure is likely to attract novice cyclists looking for a healthier commute, says deVries. \u201c(New cyclists) often feel more comfortable in cycling away from motor vehicles,\u201d says deVries, referring to the segregated bike lanes that will make up much of the bikeway\u2019s route along Albert and Scott streets.This same style of bike lane has been in place along Laurier Avenue West since its launch as a pilot project last summer. Almost 200,000 trips were recorded along the Laurier Avenue corridor in the first eight months of the project, according to Citizens for Safe Cycling \u2013 further evidence of the link between good infrastructure and increased cyclist activity. Michael Powell, former chair of the roads and cycling advisory committee, says the city is committed to developing better cycling infrastructure. \u201c(The committee) is going to keep busy making sure that money is being used in a way that is useful for cyclists,\u201d Powell said earlier this year. \u201c(We) just want to keep seeing progress.\u201dConstruction on the Ottawa East-West Bikeway is scheduled to begin next summer and be completed by November 2014.",

Argo recounts the \u201cCanadian caper\u201d involving six additional embassy staffers who fled before their colleagues were seized and who found sanctuary with Canadian diplomats, including ambassador Ken Taylor. ArgoDirected by Ben Affleck,Starring Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Kyle Chandler, Richard KindA quick, comic-book-style historical recap \u2013 noting that Western meddling resulted in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat which replaced Iran\u2019s secular parliamentary democracy with an absolute monarchy \u2013 makes way for a matter-of-fact presentation of the storming of the embassy, an opening scene all the more powerful in light of the recent attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.The militants are thorough to the point that they enlist children and carpet-weavers to piece together shredded personnel documents in the hopes of discovering any American escapees, so even once the dust has settled, the clock is ticking.With the state department mulling its options, it falls to CIA \u201cexfiltration\u201d specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) and his movie-industry contacts \u2013 make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) \u2013 to put together a fake movie so convincing it will succeed as a cover story get the six most wanted people in the Middle East out of incredible danger.Writer-director Ben Affleck, who pulled the same double duty on 2007\u2019s Gone Baby Gone and 2010\u2019s The Town, finally comes into his own in both capacities, somehow maintaining near-perfect balance in a movie that is equal parts Black Hawk Down and Ocean\u2019s Eleven \u2013 opposites that they are \u2013 combining the terrifying premise of isolation in enemy territory with the kind of far-fetched, madcap antics only Hollywood could supply (historically, it seems, as well as today).The ending may be in the history books already, but that doesn\u2019t stop Argo from bringing new meaning to the term \u201cnail-biter\u201d; as historical fiction, as a thriller inspired by actual events, or as anything else it might be called, it is positively nerve-wracking.Chalk that up partly to the extensive cast of character actors, some as well-known as they are adroit (John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston, Richard Kind, and Affleck himself) and others with faces more recognizable than their names (Clea DuVall, Philip Baker Hall, Michael Parks, Super 8\u2019s Kyle Chandler, Titanic\u2019s Victor Garber, Buffy\u2019s Tom Lenk, and a bevy of 24 alumni including Bob Gunton, \u008eeljko Ivanek, Omid Abtahi, and Christopher Stanley).Cranston is one of few who has enough of a role to sink his teeth into as Mendez\u2019s supervisor Jack O\u2019Donnell \u2013 Affleck predictably takes centre stage \u2013 and he gets plenty of support from the ample screen personalities of Arkin and Goodman, who supply sporadic and much-needed levity.If historical accuracy never goes out the window, the expected narrative tension still requires oversimplification and some notable contrivances. This retelling elides the assistance provided by diplomats from New Zealand and Britain, as well as other Canadians. A climactic confrontation is pure fabrication. And plenty more, from the abortive Operation Eagle Claw to the office of President Jimmy Carter \u2013 who lends a closing monologue to the end credits \u2013 simply falls outside the scope of the story.But Argo, in finishing, leaves the viewer with that sated feeling of having just completed a project. And that satisfaction, derived from the vicarious thrill of a success more than 30 years old, can be interpreted in more ways than one as \u201cMission Accomplished.\u201d",

Francesca L\u2019Orfano, a Little Italy resident, says she is happy to see Frederick Pantalone posthumously reinstated to the Ottawa Fire Department.\r\r\u201cThis is something that is long overdue. There are cases of this happening in various cities all over the country. When these men were released, things did not go back to normal for these families,\u201d says L\u2019Orfano.Pantalone was stripped of his job in June of 1940 soon after Italy joined the Second World War on the side of Nazi Germany. The Italian immigrant was arrested and sent to an internment camp on suspicion of being an \u201cenemy alien.\u201dL\u2019Orfano is a visual artist and professor who has worked on projects that bring light to the struggles Italian immigrants went through during this dark chapter in Canadian history.After Mussolini joined Hitler in the Second World War, Mackenzie King\u2019s government signed an order labelling thousands of Italian-Canadians as \u201cenemy aliens.\u201d More than 500 were then arrested and sent to an internment camp in Petawawa.Although some of the men in the camp were connected to Italian fascist groups most of them, like Pantalone, were falsely accused. He was released eight months later, after a judge found that he posed no threat. But the firefighter\u2019s union had lost trust in him and unanimously voted against taking him back.His son Sal Pantalone, 88, says that what hurt his father the most wasn\u2019t the arrest, but the fact that he couldn\u2019t go back to being a firefighter. So last year, he started fighting for his father\u2019s rank to be restored.In a small ceremony at city hall last month, Sal Pantalone was presented with a plaque officially declaring his father was part of the fire department. He is also making arrangements to have his father\u2019s rank be engraved on his tombstone.Last year, a memorial wall commemorating members of the Italian-Canadian community who were affected by the internment camps, was put up at Piazza Dante park on Booth Street.It holds the names of four local Italian men who were interned at camp Petawawa. Among them, is Frederick Pantalone.At the same time, L\u2019Orfano, along with other members from the Italian community, put together a booklet titled Memories to Memorial: The Internment of Ottawa\u2019s Italian Canadians during the Second World War.The booklet tells stories about the families of the men who were sent to Petawawa.Sal Pantalone says that after his father\u2019s internment many family members went their separate ways.\u201cIt ruined the family,\u201d he says.He also says that he doesn\u2019t blame the Canadian government because it was what any government would do in their situation.Frederick Pantalone was among the men who fought the great fire at Parliament Hill in 1916 that destroyed the Centre Block. It was rebuilt in 1926 with the Peace Tower, replacing the Victoria Tower that used to stand in its place.\u201cMy father always felt Canadian. I remember when my father took me to see the Parliament buildings for the first time. There was great pride in him when he showed me the Peace Tower. I guess because he was there for the demolition of the first one and the building of the new one, he felt that it was very much his own,\u201d says Sal Pantalone.Bay Coun. Mark Taylor, chair of the protective services committee, apologized for the treatment of Pantalone, on behalf of the city and the Firefighters Association.\u201cWhenever there\u2019s an opportunity to right a wrong, no matter how old it is, it should be done,\u201d says Taylor.He says the reason it took more than 70 years to correct the mistake is because people have a tendency to want to leave the past in the past.\u201cA lot of the time people are hesitant to go back and second guess the decisions that have already been made,\u201d says Taylor.",

    "body": "Taxpayers will be on the hook for the cost of converting some of OC Transpo\u2019s fleet of nearly 180 hybrid buses back to diesel after promised saving on running costs failed to materialize.\r\rIt has been just four years since Ottawa purchased the fleet of 177 hybrid buses, a deployment that was not only considered environmentally friendly but also a big potential savings on fuel costs. But after spending millions on battery replacements last year and disappointingly small fuel savings, OC Transpo wants to turn five hybrid buses into regular diesel-run vehicles to see if the entire fleet of hybrids should eventually be converted. In the draft 2013 budget, more than $550,000 is outlined for the project. \u201cThe goal is to see if converting the five is going to make economic sense and to see what kind of savings we can get,\u201d says Craig Watson, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 279.Earlier this year, OC Transpo announced no more hybrid buses would be purchased. In an email, a spokesperson for OC Transpo said it will not be commenting on any hybrid-related questions prior to the budget deliberations.The conversion to diesel engines is intended to be more economical. However, hybrid buses cost about $650,000 each \u2014 up to $150,000 more than a regular bus. On top of those original costs, each alteration from hybrid to diesel is expected to cost around $75,000 per bus. Hybrid buses run on both rechargeable batteries and smaller diesel engines. The batteries recharge every time the bus brakes so less fuel is consumed.The hybrid buses were originally bought to lower fuel costs by up to 35 per cent. However, the transit company is realizing that this has not panned out. The city ended up spending $1 million more on fuel than estimated last year.\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate situation. You can\u2019t blame the current management,\u201d says Watson. \u201cYou have to go back and blame the previous one to a certain extent. Everyone thought this technology was going to be the latest and greatest.\u201dIn 2004, the city paid the National Research Council of Canada to conduct a study on hybrid buses before any purchases were made. The study outlined that the city would only get the expected savings if the hybrid buses were used on low-speed routes with frequent stops, such as Bank Street and Somerset Street. When hybrid buses are used on high-speed roads with few stops, fuel consumption is similar to that of a regular diesel bus. \u201cIf we change over the whole fleet to diesel we will be completely throwing away our investment we made in this green technology and that would be a huge mistake because it could have been avoided,\u201d says David Jeanes, president of Transport Action Canada, an advocacy group that lobbies for better public transit. Watson explains that the purchase was made even after serious faults were found with hybrid buses in Toronto.\u201cWe continued to go ahead with the purchase and they\u2019re just not working out. They\u2019re not saving the kind of money we hoped they would save,\u201d Watson says. The 2008 budget outlined that the hybrid buses would only be used on the low-speed frequent stop routes. However, that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cInstead, they should have done their actual research and maybe we should have just bought a few of them initially for the first year and (to determine) if we were going to see some savings,\u201d Watson says about city\u2019s management of the project.Before the fleet of hybrids was purchased, Jeanes says he repeatedly told councillors the hybrids need to be tested properly. But the one-year pilot project never happened, he says.If the proposed project is a success, the rest of the fleet is expected to be converted. City council plans to vote on the draft budget this month. \u201c(This mistake) was entirely predictable,\u201d says Jeanes. \u201cThe city seemed to ignore the advice it paid for.\u201d",

The number of green offices in the entire city grew from 51 to 62, according to the report published by real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield Ottawa.\u201cIn the real estate sector, what we see is that occupiers in office buildings are demanding sustainability,\u201d says James McNeil, associate vice-president of Cushman and Wakefield, who was responsible for the report. \u201cWhat it really comes down to is supply and demand \u2013 if my customers say sustainability is important in their decision to occupy, then I as a building owner need to react to that.\u201dAt Ecology Ottawa, one of the largest green grassroots organizations in Ottawa, policy co-ordinator Trevor Hach\u00e9 says he sees \u201csome progress\u201d in attempts by business and government to be more sustainable. But he doesn\u2019t think 62 green office buildings in total in Ottawa is nearly enough.\u201cThere are some good examples of office buildings, but there is tremendous room for improvement,\u201d Hach\u00e9 says. \u201cFrom an economic point of view it just makes so much sense for property owners to be serious about energy conservation. We are talking about the potential to save the local economy hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars a year if we were serious about this.\u201dAccording to a report published by the City of Ottawa, more than 57 per cent of the city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 came from buildings. While Hach\u00e9 says the city has made some progress on its own buildings, he thinks the rest of the community is lagging.\u201cAt the moment, I wouldn\u2019t say Ottawa is a leader,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge potential to save home owners and businesses money, increase property values and give our fair share to fight catastrophic climate change.\u201dMcNeil says Ottawa is being outdone by the likes of Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington, D.C. \u201cOther cities are doing a much better job, frankly,\u201d he says. \u201cThe world is moving toward sustainability and Ottawa is being left behind.\u201dAs the federal government is moving offices out of the city centre, McNeil says he believes sustainable office buildings will be increasingly important in the attempt to attract new companies to fill the holes. \u201cWe can use it to attract leading industry to this city,\u201d says McNeil. \u201cBut it is not only about commerce. It\u2019s also about making a more liveable city.\u201d",

    "body": "Negotiations to install surveillance cameras under the Queensway on Preston Street to deter vandalism are raising questions about who should be responsible for monitoring public spaces. \r\rThe city has given the Preston Street BIA the go-ahead to mount the cameras to protect the Little Italy mural and bollards, or short posts, from vandalism. But executive director Lori Mellor says her organization doesn\u2019t feel it should take on the full responsibility and cost.\u201cWe do not think it should be at our expense since it really is the result of a failure of the police to respond,\u201d she says. She says that Little Italy\u2019s business improvement area does not have the interest or manpower to monitor the tapes. That should be the responsibility of the city,\u00a0 provincial Ministry of Transportation, or police, she says. The proposed surveillance camera would not be the first in Ottawa. There are already cameras managed by the city in public parks, swimming pools, community centres and heritage sites. \u00a0Josh Greenberg, a Carleton University communications professor who has studied the issues surrounding surveillance cameras in public spaces, says that if\u00a0 cameras are installed in the area in question, it would be better for the city to monitor the video. \u201cIt should be of concern to anyone in Ottawa that a BIA could mount a camera in public spaces,\u201d he says. He suggests that to save money and deter vandalism it would be better for the BIA to use smart environmental design such as increased lighting and should only use cameras when they are an absolute necessity.Mellor says that there is already stronger lighting under the Queensway than the Ministry of Transportation uses, including decorative lights which are themselves sometimes targets of vandalism. Michelle Chibba, director of policy and special projects for the privacy commission of Ontario, also encourages the BIA to partner with an institution such as the police or city to ensure responsible usage. The proposed cameras would be marked with signage that would let people know they are being watched, says Mellor.Since people commit most of the vandalism on weekend nights, Mellor says she hopes the signs would deter vandals to destroy or deface the murals or the bollards. \u201cThese are crimes of opportunity, the vandals see the mural and it is like Mount Everest for them. A lot of the vandals are drunken university students, the crimes aren\u2019t premeditated and we aren\u2019t looking to send them to jail. Hopefully, if they saw the camera they would think twice before doing anything,\u201d Mellor says. A review of CCTV cameras in Toronto indicates that crime was reduced in three out of five of the districts that had cameras.\u201cOur belief is that privacy should not get in the way of deterring crime or catching criminals because public safety is important,\u201d Chibba says. \u201cBut if you are going to install any technology that could impact privacy you must do so in a responsible way.\u201d Mellor says the cameras would only be reviewed after a crime was committed and the data would be erased on Tuesdays because most crime happens over the weekend.The Ontario Privacy Commission has guidelines that will help ensure the information is secure and being used properly, that videos are being monitored for the proposed purposes and that the collection of data is minimal.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be big brother,\u201d Mellor says. \u201cVandalism is costing us a fortune and we care about the neighbourhood. If you take pride in your neighbourhood and keep it clean it is less likely that vandalism will occur.\u201d",

The meeting was scheduled for two hours, but lasted an hour. It was one of a series of city-wide meetings for residents to give their input on what Watson calls a \u201cstay-the-course\u201d budget. Those who did not attend but still have\u00a0 concerns or comments have until the end of the month. \u00a0The few questions and comments ranged from such issues as transit services, the city\u2019s debt and funding for local museums. Marian Similuk, the city\u2019s treasurer, outlined the budget\u2019s main features, such as the 2.09-per-cent property tax increase. Similuk noted that while some costs will rise, including transit fees, recreation fees will not. There was even a question from Twitter. An Ottawa resident tweeted Coun. Maria McRae asking if funds geared towards road widening could be better spent on expanding O-Train services. Coun. Diane Deans, chairperson of the city\u2019s transit commission, said the city is expanding the O-Train. It\u2019s shutting down the system next year for restructuring, getting new trains from Germany in 2014, doubling capacity and reducing service times.Mike Maguire, a former mayoral candidate, expressed concern over the long-term implications of borrowing money to pay for expenditures in difficult economic times, fearing the city will continue to borrow and its debt will continue to grow unsustainably.Currently, the city\u2019s debt is at around $1.4 billion. According to Watson, it won\u2019t rise this year. Similuk said it\u2019s important to be prudent about debt, but added that Ottawa is doing well compared with other large municipalities. \u201cOttawa is not in a debt crisis,\u201d Similuk said. Robin Etherington, executive director of the Bytown Museum, commended city council for its continued support. \u201cThe Bytown Museum is strong, thanks to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThis year, we\u2019re going to have over 50,000 visitors,\u201d which is up from last year\u2019s 45,000 visitors.Etherington praised the city\u2019s two-per-cent increase in operating funding for local museums, which she said will help with the Bytown\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebrations in 2017.Other residents at the meeting said the city\u2019s new biweekly garbage pickup schedule is an inconvenience and asked council to consider more funds for road infrastructure renewal projects.Committee scrutiny of the budget began this week and continues until Nov. 26.

    "body": "Ottawa is facing a critical shortage of low- and middle-income housing units, according to the Centretown organization that\u2019s the city\u2019s main supplier of affordable housing.\r\rThe ongoing condo construction boom in downtown Ottawa will soon make it difficult for residents to find affordable housing in Centretown, says Ray Sullivan, executive director of the Centretown Citizens Ottawa Corporation. \u201cAlmost no one is building any new low-income housing units, because return on investment isn\u2019t as fast as it is for high-end units,\u201d Sullivan says.Ottawa\u2019s 2011 Annual Development Report indicates that only 8.6 per cent of new housing units built last year were considered \u201caffordable,\u201d down from 9.2 per cent in 2010.\u201cMany Centretown renters would like to buy a home, but they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cSo what do they do? They buy a home in Barrhaven instead. Suddenly, the Queensway\u2019s all clogged up every morning because people live too far to walk or bike to work . . . That just doesn\u2019t work with the city\u2019s vision for a more green, accessible downtown core.\u201dAccording to Sullivan, two out of five Ottawa renters cannot afford their rental costs and half of them pay more for their rent than their gross income reasonably allows for. The condo boom makes it difficult for new housing developments to be affordable and for non-profit rental developers like CCOC to buy land.\u201cIt also makes it harder for regular folks looking to rent to be able to afford condos, because their speculative value is so high,\u201d he says.For Sullivan, the answer lies in extending lower interest rates to buyers and to change mortgage eligibility policies. But others think developers can play a helpful role as well.\u201cThere is going to have to be some give and take,\u201d says Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association. \u201cThe condo developers need to recognize that affordable housing is key to ensure that we can keep a mix of people who want to live downtown and can afford to live downtown.\u201dThe government also has a role to play, he says.\u201cAs Ottawa grows, the number of people who live in the streets or in the shelters grows,\u201d Dekker says. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us as a community, as a municipality and as a humanity to make sure that we look after those who have those needs, through a cooperation of all levels of government.\u201dAbout $43 million in combined federal, provincial and municipal funding was allocated in January to help build new affordable rental housing units and to repair existing ones over the next few years.In May, combined funding of $145 million was also pledged province-wide to build new affordable housing units for seniors, persons with disabilities and low-income families, according to an announcement through Canada\u2019s Economic Action Plan and the Canada-Ontario Affordable Housing Program Agreement. The aim of that funding is to build 1,282 units in 27 developments across Ontario.Some of that money is already helping out in Centretown, where CCOC recently inaugurated one of its most successful housing projects yet. The Beaver Barracks development, located on Metcalfe, Argyle and Catherine streets, has 254 affordable units.\u201cThe Beaver Barracks has been an amazing city project on affordable housing,\u201d Dekker says, \u201cbut where they have property to put more of these types of buildings, I just don\u2019t know.\u201d",

    "body": "It\u2019s difficult to figure out why the city has a problem with building condominiums near Preston Street. Last week, plans for the development of a 42-storey tower on Preston Street were put on hold because the city wants to review the recent interest in high-rise developments in the area. \r\rClaridge Homes, a condo developer, filed a request for new zoning earlier this year to build what would be the city\u2019s tallest building at 505 Preston. After months of consideration, the proposal should have been voted upon by now by city council. Instead, what Claridge Homes got is a vague and ambiguous explanation from development review program manager John Smit, forcing the developer\u00a0 to wait until 2013 for a decision on whether they can move forward or not. It\u2019s not clear what exactly the city wants to review, what specifically it objects to, or even if it objects to anything at all. The ambiguity aside, it\u2019s hard to understand why there would be a problem with the proposed Claridge Homes building. According to the 2011 census, the city\u2019s population grew by almost nine per cent since 2006 and is projected to grow even more. Indeed, Ottawa is the fourth largest city in the nation and the second largest in Ontario. As the city continues to grow, so will demand for more residential spaces. Perhaps the city is wary of a condo bubble forming in Ottawa\u2019s real estate market? But Ottawa is not Vancouver or Toronto. The real estate market here is relatively stable, partly because most of its residents are working in different areas of the government. And according to the census, the largest age group in Ottawa is 45-49 year olds, with the second largest group being 50-54 year olds \u2013 older professionals who have steady jobs and income. Nonetheless, the city ought to realize that Claridge Homes and other developers don\u2019t just decide to build high-rise condos without the proper demand for them in the first place; otherwise, they would lose money. In addition to that, the federal government\u2019s tightening of the mortgage rules makes it difficult for those who can\u2019t afford it to buy homes outside their means. So what exactly is the city\u2019s planning committee afraid of?Preston Street contains the city\u2019s Little Italy district \u2013 a host of restaurants, bakeries, and shops, making it one of the most sought-out neighbourhoods for residents wanting to move closer to the downtown core. It\u2019s easy to see why people want to move there, and why developers want to build homes there.But then again, we don't know why the city is stalling the development of various condos near Preston Street and certainly, they ought to offer a more clear and concise explanation of what is going on. The sudden news of postponing the decision, without a proper reason as to why, harms city council's desire for transparency and responsability. If the city thinks there is a problem with the developments in that section of the city, the public has a right to know.\"",

    "body": "Public policy considerations are what Immigration Minister Jason Kenney is citing as the reasons for new ministerial powers to bar certain people from coming into Canada. \r\rKenney\u2019s proposal is included in the contentious Bill C-43, which has passed second reading in the House of Commons and is currently being examined by the Commons immigration committee. The bill is a set of provisions to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Canadians who care about the balance of powers and the nature of government should be worried about Kenney\u2019s expansionist hopes, as well as the new bill, the Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act. Canadian border services already has the power to bar individuals from the country if they violate certain standards. So what exactly motivates Kenney to want to expand this power for himself? What does he mean by \u201cpublic policy considerations?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of murkiness in this,\u201d says Omar Hameed, a former access and equity officer with the Canadian Arab Federation, an organization that advocates for immigrants and refugees. \u201cThere\u2019s an authoritarian air about it, and it\u2019s at least partially aimed at altering public opinion in Canada in favour of the Tories.\u201d Hameed notes that he is worried about Kenney\u2019s \u201cpower grab\u201d as a move to limit dissenting voices and define the limits of discussion. Kenney tabled two weeks ago what he says are a set of \u201cnarrow criteria\u201d to demonstrate why the expansion of his authority is necessary. He insists that countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have already given their immigration ministers the very same authority. Unfortunately, these guidelines are still vague. They stipulate that\u00a0 Kenney should bar corrupt foreign officials from countries upon which Canada has imposed sanctions, and people who promote terrorism, violence or criminal activity. Kenney says that the recent barring of Pastor Terry Jones, the American cleric behind \u201cInternational Burn a Koran Day,\u201d is further proof that he should be given the powers he requests. Concern for Bill C-43, with a Conservative majority in the Commons, is predicated largely on how Kenney will interpret the terms of his \u201cnarrow criteria.\u201d Canadians can only assess this by his past behaviour on this front. For instance, in March 2009, Kenney used his contacts and rapport with the Canadian Border Services Agency, as well as his own influence, to ban British MP George Galloway from entering Canada on the grounds that Galloway violated section 34(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which among other things bars foreign nationals who are a deemed a security risk to Canada. The minister cited Galloway\u2019s delivery of $1.2 million in aid earlier that year to Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip (under an Israeli embargo) via Galloway\u2019s \u201cViva Palestina\u201d delegation as a case of providing material support for the Hamas party which governs the Gaza Strip. Canada designates Hamas as a terrorist group.Federal Court Judge Richard Mosley issued a judgment on the ban, in which he found that Kenney\u2019s campaign was based primarily on distaste for Galloway\u2019s political views, in particular his assistance of Palestine.\u00a0\u201cKenney\u2019s just trying to make official what he and his office do on a regular basis already,\u201d says James Clark, a central organizer of Galloway\u2019s tour in 2010 and now a PhD candidate at York University. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to bury his office\u2019s approach in legislation and provide cover for himself by portraying this request as a progressive move.\u201d Clark, who is also an organizer with the Toronto Coalition Against the War, notes that Kenney\u2019s packaging of his proposals as a way to exclude problematic figures such as Jones is highly dubious. The minister has in previous years also cut funding to the Canadian Arab Federation, which used to provide job search workshops and ESL classes for a large number of new Muslims (among others) in Canada. Salmaan Khan, a colleague of Clark\u2019s at the Coalition, and a student at Ryerson University, agrees with this assessment. He says that it is inaccurate to see Kenney\u2019s \u201cconsolidation of power\u201d as something new. Rather, he notes, \u201cit\u2019s more of the same, and Kenney\u2019s approach will remain the way it is now with or without Bill C-43.\u201d Kenney\u2019s attempt to assume for himself the powers of \u201cnegative discretion,\u201d and ban whoever he sees fit from Canada is yet another testament to the Conservative government\u2019s authoritarian streak. There are already mechanisms within Canada\u2019s federal bureaucracy, namely border services, to deal with individuals who pose security threats to Canadians. Turning away Jones was a decision made by the border services, which cited the potential for violent protest given Jones\u2019 prejudices. A good decision or not, it was a choice made by a body that operates at arm\u2019s length from other centres of authority within the Canadian political system.To conflate this bureaucratic process and concentrate powers into the hands of one man is a way of bypassing the separation of powers and disregarding the gap between bureaucratic process and political whim. No matter how narrow Kenney says his criteria will be, Canadians should be wary of attempts to consolidate the powers of exclusion in the hands of a single politician. ",

    "body": "In October, Census Canada released a report that showed that the dominance of both English and French as official languages in the country has declined significantly. \r\rThe data showed that the number of Canadians who spoke another language at home was on the rise, in particular Punjabi, Chinese, Spanish and Philippines-based Tagalog. While some considered these figures as a manifestation of great Canadian multiculturalism, others quickly painted it as an alarming linguistic drift that demands immediate attention. Quebec Premier Pauline Marois responded with promises of \u201crobust\u00a0\u201c language reforms in the province while others saw the trend as further proof that Canada\u2019s days as a predominantly white, English-speaking society are numbered. According to the census data, the number of Canadians who reported speaking two or more languages at home was 17.5 per cent in 2011, up from 14.2 per cent five years ago. Yet, although the numbers are on the rise, it means that the average Canadian is still only able to speak one or maybe two languages.But with the country increasingly diversifying, is it necessarily a bad thing that Canada\u2019s linguistic landscape has shifted to reflect it? More important, why are we surprised that immigrants are increasingly choosing to hold onto their respective cultures and tongues? Have we hit a new benchmark of multiculturalism or has our little melting pot finally become a bit too hot for some to handle?With the diversity of new Canadian families and the dawn of the information age, the country\u2019s cultural colours might as well be fluorescent compared to the shades of grey they were just a few decades ago. The Internet has allowed us to effortlessly peer into and interact with cultures across the globe, while the speed and efficiency at which we can freely roam the planet has never been greater. The global village is not only very real, it\u2019s shrinking, and way faster than many expected. We may not exactly be jumping on the idea of a society full of polyglots, but others around the world sure seem to be. In Europe, many university programs require students to spend at least one semester studying in another country, known as the Erasmus Program. These intercultural exchanges require students to study a second and sometimes even a third language, both in and outside the classroom. The result is a European Union where people not only understand neighbouring cultures, they also have the ability to discuss them in their own tongues. Maybe instead of trying to build up what\u2019s left of our linguistic defences, it\u2019s time for Canadians to get with the program and dust off the old \u201cTagalog 101\u201d textbook. We may officially be a bilingual country, but it\u2019s definitely not a bilingual world out there. Canadians, especially young Canadians, should be striving to learn as many languages as possible, rather than retreating at the sight of a cryptic character, or heaven forbid, a foreign verb that needs a little conjugation. If we do not embrace our linguistic multiculturalism and instead chose to fight it, we will ultimately be left behind in a new world where the ability to communicate is everything and those who can\u2019t keep up inevitably get shut out.

Men\u2019s soccer has yet to make much of an impact on the Ottawa sports scene, but there are hopes that will change in 2014 when a new professional soccer franchise kicks off at Lansdowne Park.\r\rThe team will compete in the North American Soccer League, a Division II league with teams from the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Although Ottawa was awarded a NASL franchise last year, the recent Lansdowne vote has cemented a home ground for the team. The season will start on the road until Lansdowne Park is ready. John Pugh, owner of the Ottawa Fury and Ottawa\u2019s new professional team, has high hopes the team will follow the lead of previous Canadian NASL teams.\u201cOur goal is to follow in the footsteps of teams like Montreal and Vancouver who played in division one soccer for over a decade before they moved up to the MLS,\u201d he says. There is, however, a long way to go before that can happen. With no expansion draft in the NASL, gaining the players needed to be a competitive force in the league could be a challenge. \u201cWe already get emails from prospective players every day,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cThere is no draft as such . . . but the head coach will have a lot of connections and a choice of players to look at.\u201dKenny Caceros, Fury youth program graduate and current NASL player for FC Edmonton, is one player interested in joining the Ottawa team. He says it was only a matter of time before Ottawa got a professional team. \u201cFury has done a lot for me in terms of development as a player on and off the field. I would like to give back by helping the club succeed at the professional level,\u201d says Caceros. \u201cIn 2014, I\u2019ll have had two years at the NASL level under my belt and I would very much enjoy bringing that experience back home to Ottawa.\u201dQuestions have been raised over whether there will be enough demand to fill the 24,000-seat stadium. Currently, the Ottawa Fury Premier Development League team has an average attendance in the hundreds. The highest average attendance for an NASL team last season was 11,507 for the Montreal Impact. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fill the stadium for every league game,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cWe will be doing whatever we can to make it feel intimate, by blocking off the seating and so on.\u201d The Vancouver Whitecaps have similar procedures in place for match days at BC Place. While Ottawa isn\u2019t necessarily known as a soccer city, NASL commissioner David Downs has hopes for a fan base for the team. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to Ottawa\u2019s on-field contribution to the NASL in 2014 and are confident the city\u2019s soccer fans will support the club in style,\u201d says Downs. The name of the soon-to-be club is still uncertain. A competition will be held to decide whether the team will be the Ottawa Fury or another name chosen by fans. ",

    "body": "The most promising basketball player to ever come out of a Canadian gym could take his talents to the National Basketball Association as early as 2014. \r\rAndrew Wiggins, a 17-year-old from Thornhill, Ont., announced his reclassification into the 2013 recruiting class last month, meaning he will be eligible to turn pro and enter the NBA draft in 2014 \u2013 one year earlier than expected. This news bodes well for Canada Basketball and the senior men\u2019s national team\u2019s hopes of qualifying for the 2016 Olympic Games and potentially bringing home a medal for the first time since 1936. Wiggins\u2019 reclassification doesn\u2019t change his status for 2016; he will be eligible to represent Canada regardless. It will, however, give him an extra year of experience to hone his skills in the NBA before attempting to lead Canada at the raw age of 21. Of course, that\u2019s assuming he even needs it. The 6\u20197\u201d small forward is the projected number one overall pick in 2014 \u2013 just as he was in 2015 and just as he probably would be in 2013. He\u2019s that good. He\u2019s even drawn loose comparisons to LeBron James, who happens to be one of the most dominant players to ever play the game. Most recently, ESPN\u2019s director of basketball recruiting called Wiggins the best perimeter prospect since James. The fact that Wiggins is even mentioned in the same breath as \u201cKing James\u201d is saying something.And fortunately for Canada Basketball, he bleeds red and white. \u201cPlaying for Canada, it\u2019s an honour, it\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d Wiggins was quoted in a June 2012 Toronto Star article. \u201cI love it, representing Canada wherever I go.\u201dWiggins, whose father played in the NBA and mother competed in the Olympics as a sprinter, has already paid his dues with Canada\u2019s junior national team and will surely join the senior squad sooner rather than later. It could use the help. Canada has never been a powerhouse basketball nation. For years, the senior men\u2019s national team has been mediocre at best. It hasn\u2019t qualified for the last three Olympic Games and finished a disappointing 22nd at the 2010 FIBA World Championships \u2013 a 24-team competition put on by the International Basketball Federation. But with Wiggins as the poster boy, the tides are turning. No one\u2019s expecting Wiggins to lead Canada to the promise land on his own \u2013 a tall task for someone his age. And fortunately, he won\u2019t have to.The 2012-13 NBA season kicked off last week and a record eight Canadians featured on opening day rosters \u2013 five of which were drafted in the last two years. This list includes Cleveland Cavaliers power forward Tristan Thompson, the highest drafted Canadian-born player of all-time (fourth overall in 2011). With the likes of top college prospects Myck Kabongo, Anthony Bennett, Tyler Ennis, Trey Liles, and Kyle Wiltjer (just to name a few) still to come, that number will certainly increase within the next few years. Then, in 2014, it will be Wiggins\u2019 time to shine. And he\u2019ll have a full two years to adjust to the physical and psychological demands of the professional game before the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An extra year of experience may not seem like much, but at such a young age, it could make a drastic difference. James, for example, saw his average point total increase by seven points in his second year of play, and was named the league MVP the following season.If Wiggins even comes close to that career path, then Canadian basketball fans are in for a treat. With Steve Nash at the helm as general manager and an abundance of young talent ready and willing to play, the Canadian men\u2019s basketball team has never been in better shape. And the best part about it?In 2016, it will only be scratching the surface. ",

    "body": "Jill Adams, Centretown NewsAlex deVries fastens a free, working light to the bike of a passing  cyclist as part of a campaign to promote cyclists' visibility. A campaign to increase cyclist visibility and reduce dangers on Ottawa roads during the dark winter months will target cyclists who disregard safety and the law.\r\rThe project, a partnership between Citizens for Safe Cycling and the City of Ottawa, aims to raise awareness about the dangers of cycling without lights at night by stopping passing cyclists and giving them free lights.The first light handout was scheduled to take place near the Corktown Footbridge, a busy crossing that carries pedestrians and cyclists across the canal from the east end of Somerset Street West to the edge of the University of Ottawa campus. On either side are paved multi-use pathways for cyclists, walkers and runners.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to target those people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t buy a bike light,\u201d says Alex deVries, vice-president of Citizens for Safe Cycling, a non-profit volunteer organization that advocates on behalf of cyclists in Ottawa. DeVries started the campaign, which is partnered with the city\u2019s Safer Roads Ottawa program. The program aims to improve safety for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians on the city\u2019s roads. The program reports to the city\u2019s transportation committee, chaired by Kanata Coun. Marianne Wilkinson.Wilkinson says police will be at the campaign, stopping lightless cyclists, who will either have to accept a ticket or take a free set of lights and a lesson on installation. \u201cI think most people will take the lights,\u201d Wilkinson says. Cycling without lights can result in a $20 fine.The initiative is not in direct response to the recent death of cyclist Krista Johnston, who was killed on the Bronson Avenue bridge on Oct. 18, but has actually been in the works for about six months, says deVries. Each year, cyclists put themselves in danger by ignoring basic safety precautions such as lights, which become more and more important as dusk comes early.Bike lights are mandatory by law for a reason, says Wilkinson. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very dangerous. I don\u2019t know if they realize how invisible they are,\u201d she says. Reflectors just aren\u2019t enough, say both deVries and Wilkinson. They do not provide enough visibility to prevent accidents.Approximately 200 sets of LED lights, each with a $30 value, will be given away free of charge to cyclists riding unlighted bicycles. As per the law, one light will be white for the front of the bike and the other will be red for the back. These lights \u201care better than what most people currently have,\u201d DeVries says. The paths along the canal are the property of the National Capital Commission.Although the NCC is not partnered with the bike light campaign, the federal agency will \u201crecognize and support\u201d it, says Jean Charbonneau, NCC land manager. The NCC has other safety initiatives in place, such as the Share the Path code of conduct. The use of lights is not included in these guidelines but the use of bells is.\u00a0",

The city has promised residents more  options after approving 20 new street food locations for next summer.   Hotdogs and sausages topped with mustard and relish and garnished with onions. Salty fries soaked in vinegar or covered in gravy and slowly melting cheese curds. \r\rA new municipal street food selection panel wants these classic street eats swapped for \u201chealthy, innovative and diverse food options,\u201d according to an October report from the Community and Protective Services committee. But healthier alternatives can\u2019t take the heat of the street food industry. Literally.The chip trucks that line Bank Street are too small and too hot to handle much beyond hotdogs, sausages, and fries, says street food vendor Bao Linh. He would know. Fifteen years in the business and despite his Vietnamese roots, his Bank Street chip truck has remained staunchly in line with street eats tradition. \u201cIf you have a chip truck, the best thing to do, you sell poutine, hotdogs, fries, hamburgers,\u201d says Linh.Because when it comes to cooking in a truck, size matters.Permit holders asked for larger trucks, according to the report, and on Oct. 24 their wish was granted. City council amended the business licensing bylaw that mandated a truck\u2019s exterior had to be one metre wide or less, increasing the maximum width to 1.2 metres on a case-by-case basis says Philip Powell, manager of licensing, permits and markets for the city.This extra space gives trucks more cooking and refrigeration room, says Powell, which are vital to healthier choices.Linh\u2019s truck has a propane-powered fridge he says works for foods that will be cooked, like hotdogs and sausages, but not for much else.\u00a0\u201cSo if you carry milk, it\u2019s no good,\u201d Linh says. \u201cThe temperature is not cold enough to protect milk.\u201dWhile vendors are happy with the new size, not all are fans of the new selection panel. The panel of five represents the Ottawa Hotel, Motel and Restaurant Association, the Canadian Culinary Foundation (Ottawa Branch), Savour Ottawa, Just Food, and the Ottawa Board of Health. It will evaluate vendors\u2019 menus when they apply for a new space and have the final say on any menu changes. Linh refused to comment on the city influencing what vendors sell, but vendor Terry Scanlon was more vocal. A near-permanent fixture on the corner of Bank Street and Laurier Avenue for 30 years, Scanlon told councillors the idea of a panel dictating what vendors could sell concerned him. But for some, healthier street eats in Centretown sounds pretty good, panel-dictated or not. Avid sushi fan Zineb Adref says hotdogs are the first things that come to mind when someone says street food. But she\u2019s not a fan, and she\u2019d like to see a little more variety. \u201cSushi, I guess, more vegetarian meals,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything other than hotdogs.\u201dDayvid Ahmadi would also like to see healthier options on the menu. But, he says, he\u2019s not sure how street vendors could prepare something like shawarma in a chip truck. And Adref has her doubts that healthier street foods will become as popular as the infamous street meats.Vendors interested in changing the face of Ottawa\u2019s street eats, one menu at a time, have until Dec. 15 to apply for one of the 20 new spaces the city council approved last month.

    "body": "Demands for transparency on investment rules have multiplied in recent weeks following the federal government\u2019s decision to block the proposed takeover of Progress Energy, a Calgary-based natural gas company, by the Malaysian state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd.\r\rAfter Prime Minister Stephen Harper put the kibosh to the $5-billion deal on a Friday at midnight, a move apparently designed to avoid a media flap, one commentator wrote that Canada\u2019s murky investment rules create too much uncertainty \u201cat a time when Canada badly needs billions of dollars to build the vast infrastructure needed to get resources to hungry global markets.\u201dAt the time of writing, commentators are also fretting about how Ottawa will deal with the proposed $15-billion takeover of the Nexen oil and gas company by a Chinese state-controlled company, and whether \u201ctransparency\u201d will prevail over obscure backroom decisions by politicians. It\u2019s ironic to see these discussions take centre stage while the Harper government quietly implements a shady deal with China known as the Foreign Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement .It\u2019s true that to the current federal government transparency is anathema, but critics miss the point by focusing on deals such as the Nexen takeover.We should be more concerned that Ottawa is willing to push the FIPA into law without any debate in Parliament or any study by the House of Commons industry committee.The environmental website DeSmogBlog cites international investment expert Gus Van Harten, who suggests the deal could tie the hands of Canadian lawmakers. In an interview posted on the website last month, Van Harten says the FIPA will allow Chinese investors to challenge any law or regulation enacted by Canadian authorities such as provincial legislatures, Parliament, or the judicial system. Investors will be able to take their complaints to international arbitrators, whose decisions can\u2019t be appealed in any Canadian court, Van Harten says. A government attempting to enact stronger environmental laws governing, say, a tar sands pipeline could find arbitrators demanding massive compensation for investors who see such measures as a violation of their rights. Canada, Van Harten adds, will be locked into the deal for at least 31 years under the terms of the agreement. And we\u2019d be remiss to ignore the impact the agreement could have for people living under the repressive Chinese regime. FIPA could stymie efforts to improve human rights in China by giving Canadian multinational corporations the right to sue the Chinese state over any laws that could be bad for business, according to Harjap Grewal, an organizer with the Council of Canadians, a leftist social advocacy group. In a post on the group\u2019s blog, Grewal notes that China has increasingly allowed multinational corporations to take land from farmers and write their own laws. \u201cEntering FIPA with Canada will provide one more instrument for multinational corporations to grab land from under the feet of farmers in China,\u201d he writes. On the other hand, supporters of such investment treaties, such as former Liberal Industry Minister John Manley (who is now the head of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, an association of CEOs), say these deals encourage economic growth through stability. The idea is that FIPAs extend certain protections to foreign investors that domestic businesses already enjoy. One example is security from expropriation without compensation, in which the state summarily seizes a company\u2019s assets. Such guarantees of protection reap benefits from newly confident investors, including oodles of capital flowing into the economy, which leads to job creation. Or so writes Manley in a statement titled \u201cWho benefits from foreign investment?\u201d posted on the website for the Ministry of International Trade. Manley also notes that such deals mean access to new markets for Canadian companies competing abroad. These Canadian multinationals tend to enjoy higher profits, he writes, due partly to their \u201cability to exploit economies of scale and scope.\u201d But this language of exploitation - with all of its historical baggage, and deployed so casually by FIPA promoters like Manley - should raise eyebrows for anyone concerned about the degree of power that global corporations have over government policies designed to protect people and the environment. This is especially true when it comes to decisions made by arbitrators operating behind closed doors. To implement this treaty without a political debate is the antithesis of transparency, and much more significant than the much-maligned opacity of current investment rules that may hold back oil and gas development, such as the Nexen deal.",

The events include networking nights, seminars and the Ottawa Entrepreneurship Awards.StartUp Weekend is kicking off GEW today with a competition at Shopify\u2019s office in the Byward Market to launch a business over the course of one weekend. This will be the second-ever StartUp Weekend in Ottawa. Myles Foster\u2019s business was created from the first.Foster came up with the idea for Foodic.us in one of his Carleton University business classes: an online platform where consumers can order fast food and choose when they want to pick it up, skipping long lines in the process.The idea won a class competition and when Foster heard about StartUp Weekend in April, he set his sights on conquering that as well.\u201cWe worked the entire weekend on (Foodic.us) and it came about that I presented it and we won second place, which was awesome,\u201d Foster says.Among Foodic.us\u2019 prizes was three months of free office space at Invest Ottawa, where it continues to work today. Foster also got his own unexpected prize. He is now one of the co-organizers of StartUp Weekend Ottawa.It is through GEW events like this that Bruce Lazenby, president and CEO of Invest Ottawa, hopes to promote his message: \u201cCreating a job is as good or better than getting a job,\u201d Lazenby says.From its offices at 80 Aberdeen St., Invest Ottawa supports 400 companies that are either starting up in Ottawa or based elsewhere and expanding to the Ottawa market.

With the Mayan Calendar indicating the coming apocalypse this December, local artist and award-winning poet David O\u2019Meara set out to tackle the notion of impending doom in Live Radio Play.\r\rThe play is an homage to old-time radio plays where the voice acting, music and sound effects are produced on the spot. O\u2019Meara enlisted the help of Jennilee Murray and Ian Keteku to write and act out the play and sought local musician Mike Dubue and cellist Octavie Dostaler-Lalonde to compose the soundtrack.The group premiered the show at Knox Presbyterian Church on Elgin Street during the annual Ottawa International Writer\u2019s Festival last week. The apocalypse is hardly a new theme to be explored, but Dubue and O\u2019Meara take a unique approach to it in their writing. \u201cEveryone\u2019s idea of the end is different,\u201d O\u2019Meara says. \u201cApocalyptic films tend to be pre-apocalypse or post, where people are dealing with the aftermath.\u201dIn writing the play, O\u2019Meara explored situations people might exaggeratingly construe as the end of the world. These situations aren\u2019t quite apocalyptic, but to the characters portrayed in the play, some common life events seem nearly insurmountable.\u201cThe end of the world\u201d is a phrase that gets thrown out there a lot. It means different things to different people but it rarely indicates an end to life as we know it. In one scene, a couple expecting a baby reminisces about a condom breaking during a past vacation. The man saw the subsequent conception as the end of the world. In another scene, a man tries to feed a sick woman a fruit smoothie, but she\u2019s so ill that she can't taste or enjoy it. Her inability to enjoy taste is its own doomsday.The play lasts about an hour and moves through a dozen-plus scenes. The transitions between the scenes are abrupt, usually ending with the gentle notes of cellist Dostaler-Lalonde.Keteku, known more for being the current World Poetry Slam champion, says it was hard to conduct research before writing this style of play, given the lack of recent material in the genre. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever listened to a radio play outside of school,\u201d says Keteku. Digging back into archives to find these productions was a challenge, he said. But the challenge helped give him some appreciation for the work that goes into creating a completely live show.Dubue, another local talent known for his band Hilotrons, composed the score for the play and orchestrated most of the sound effects during the live performance. He said he spent hours creating digital sound samples and building acoustic gadgets to be incorporated in the show.Instruments, soundboards and other untraditional gizmos surround Dubue. At one point, he pulled out a cellist\u2019s bow and slowly dragged it across the edges of a xylophone\u2019s bars, creating screechy, tense notes that cut through the melancholy of Dostaler-Lalonde\u2019s cello.Originally, the group had planned to do the entire set live, without the aid of pre-recorded sounds and digital audio effects. \u201cThere is something to be said for the sort of contemporary radio play, whereby you\u2019re not relying solely on organic materials to create your sound,\u201d Keteku says. \u201cThe technology that is used today is part of the technology that we\u2019re employing in creating this radio play, and it\u2019s a sort of amalgamation of electric-acoustic stuff.\"\u201cI would never think of getting anything this big for anything,\u201d he continues, pointing to the four-foot high, wooden contraption the group uses to produce the sound of wind. One of the actors turns a crank-arm and a cloth conveyor belt winds around a wooden cylinder producing a very convincing howling of wind.The contraption is used throughout the play and in the final scene, where two characters stare off into an abyss. As the howling of the wind calms down, the room goes silent, but applause doesn\u2019t start until O\u2019Meara lets the audience know the play is over.\u201cWell, we should have practiced the ending a little more,\u201d quips O\u2019Meara.",

It skims over the dark despair\u00a0 typical of the genre in favour of a light tone and steady wit.The novel is getting a lot of attention in Canada because it\u2019s co-written by Canadian-favourite Margaret Atwood. But her writing partner, U.K. author Naomi Alderman, is little known in North America.Atwood teamed up with Alderman as part of the Rolex Mentor and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Arts Initiative, which pairs young artists with accomplished mentors in their artistic field. Like Charles Dickens\u2019 Bleak House and Henry James\u2019 Portrait of a Lady, The Happy Zombie Sunrise Home is a serialized novel. Its first installment was published two weeks ago on Wattpad, a community reading website, and new chapters are published there every Wednesday until it concludes. While some publishers and academics say e-books have killed the written word, Alderman and Atwood say they see online publishing as another way to reach readers.\u201cMy college teacher, Northrop Frye, said you should let the young begin with whatever interests them; and millions of them are interested in Wattpad,\u201d Atwood told the Guardian. Atwood is no stranger to the power of social media; her daily tweets are followed by over 350,000 people.\u00a0This constant contact with her readership has helped her promote her latest works, whether it\u2019s an e-book or a traditional print novel.But it\u2019s Alderman who stands to gain the most from e-publishing. As an emerging writer (her first novel, Disobedience, was published in 2006, followed by Lessons in 2010), Alderman\u2019s readership is a fraction of Atwood\u2019s.Young writers in Ottawa can take a cue from Alderman and find readers online. Wattpad publishes works by tens of thousands of writers. Some of them are well known, but many of them are starting out. Often, it\u2019s often easier for young authors to find a home online than in print.By tapping into the 10-million-plus readers who subscribe to Wattpad,\u00a0 Alderman has access to a ready-made fan base. By publishing the novel in segments,\u00a0 Alderman and Atwood give readers a chance to get hooked and spread the word online.But although the built-in readership of Wattpad and its ilk is a draw, it can be hard to get noticed among the throng. Atwood\u2019s prestige keeps The Happy Zombie Sunrise Home front and centre among readers. Few aspiring novelists have such a well-known writer sharing their byline.Whether it\u2019s in ink or HTML, the written word often benefits from a little publicity. ",

They are part of the Rebranding Bytown exhibit by artist Michele Provost. Upon viewing the new exhibition at the Bytown museum, visitors may wonder if they\u2019re in a quirky gift shop.\r\r\u201cRebranding Bytown\u201d is the name of Michele Provost\u2019s witty critique of museum boutiques, which opened at the community heritage museum at the end of October.The local artist\u2019s rebranding campaign intentionally ignores notable historic events and focuses on objects that represent Ottawa residents who have been forgotten by the passing of time, such as imagery from embroidered pillow cases, old children\u2019s toys and old board games.She has used these historical artifacts, entirely for their visual appeal, to create handmade versions of commercial objects, including T-shirts, backpacks, playing cards, key chains and mugs. Each object displays an image of an artifact found in the museum\u2019s collection.\u201c(Provost) has taken a very interesting approach to her artwork, challenging all museums and art galleries to truly think through their mandate,\u201d says Robin Etherington, the museum\u2019s executive director.\u201cThe question is, how do we sell museums without selling out?\u201dUsing her artistic talents, Provost critiques the role commerce plays in the operation of a local history museum by taking often overlooked artifacts and displaying them as\u00a0if they are mass-produced museum merchandise, complete with a brand logo.A popular piece among the museum staff is Provost\u2019s take on a 19th-century slate board. In the Victorian era, students used slate boards and chalk to write with. Provost draws the same picture using chalk on the slate board, as she displays on the packaging of a 21st-century iPad.\u201cProvost asks us to imagine what happens when a museum\u2019s need to generate revenue triggers a marketing campaign that gets out of hand and distorts the image of the museum entirely,\u201d curator Judith Parker said at the exhibition\u2019s opening reception.Provost said she wanted to draw attention to the fact that cultural institutions are often forced to function as a business. Rather than funding art and artists, much of a museum budget goes towards hiring consultants and graphic artists and selling merchandise.\u201cI\u2019ve played a bit of a trick to try to make people think about what culture is, how it should be protected and if cultural institutions have to fit into this commercial mode to sell, sell, sell.\u201d\u201cCould it be that our aim is other than financial?\u201d she added.Provost says she hopes the exhibit will bring attention to the idea that people often get more excited about the boutiques in galleries and museums, rather than the art and the history.\u201cYou think that you\u2019re walking into a boutique at the exhibit and that\u2019s normal,\u201d Provost explains.\u201cBut as you\u2019re looking, everything is nailed down, there are tags everywhere but no prices, and there are no shop attendants.

The 16 photos displayed include everything from candid portraits of tired soldiers to striking shots of combat casualties. Each picture is accompanied by a behind-the-lens commentary, which draws on interviews with the photographer and the subject to explain what was happening in the photo.The artist behind the pictures is award-winning Canadian photojournalist Louie Palu, who embedded himself with both Canadian and American soldiers during their time in Afghanistan. Palu\u2019s work has been on the cover of Newsweek magazine and has been featured everywhere from France to China.Andrew Burtch, post-1945 historian at the museum, worked with Palu to develop the exhibit. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment in time in Afghanistan captured in a frame,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are portraits of faces in the war we\u2019ve rarely seen in the news.\u201dEach photo tells a story. A young soldier sits shell-shocked, cradling his gun after fighting off an insurgent ambush. A frightened Afghan soldier turns to his Canadian comrade for encouragement as he gets ready to shoot during a long firefight.Burtch says he hopes the photos will give viewers a better idea of what the everyday slog of conflict is like. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of trying to put people in the moment,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut I think these pictures really speak for themselves.\u201dPalu himself says he aims for viewers to take away a deeper understanding of war. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important for me is to empower people with information,\u201d he says. \u201cI want people to have their own personal dialogue on what war and violence is, why it happens, and who the people are in the photographs.\u201dPalu says he hopes the exhibit will help spread discussions about war among viewers, and even the media.Michael Blais, founder and president of Canadian Veterans Advocacy, agrees exhibits such as these are vital to the public\u2019s understanding of conflict.\u201cFar too often, the brutal images of war are sanitized for the Canadian public, and as a consequence, there is a comprehension disconnect in truly understanding the horrors of the Afghanistan war,\u201d he said in a statement.Veterans also appreciate these honest depictions of war, he continued. Afghanistan veterans are sometimes marginalized in favour of the \u201ctraditional\u201d veterans of the First World War and the Second World War, he said, but exhibits such as these work toward all veterans receiving the same standard of respect.\u201cAs veterans,\u201d said Blais, \u201cI feel that we have an obligation to . . . ensure that (soldiers\u2019) sacrifices in Afghanistan are not forgotten amongst our communities.\u201dKandahar \u2013 The Fighting Season runs from Nov. 1 to Sept. 22, 2013 in the north corridor of the museum.",

However, struggles to address soil contamination from the industries that used to occupy the Flats left the land unused until 2004. It was then that the NCC began accepting building proposals from developers \u2013 one of which was proposed by Claridge Homes. The company won the rights after the other two contenders dropped out, saying the NCC had introduced new conditions that made the project uneconomical.Fusion, the name of the latest project by Claridge Homes, will introduce a six-storey condo on Fleet Street and an eight-story tower on Lett Street, with stacked, boutique-style townhomes in between the two.

The first, Ripley says, is to provide Ottawa police with insight into youth culture and trends in order to ensure police messages of crime prevention and personal safety reach the intended audience.\u201cThe other purpose is to be a voice for youth in the community around ideas they might have, concerns they might have. They can bring it forward to our youth advisory committee, and then our youth advisory committee can bring it forward to Ottawa Police Services,\u201d she says.The idea to form a committee to work with Ottawa police was conceived after an event last year that was meant to foster communication between the youth of Ottawa and police. The \u201cLet\u2019s Chat Youth Caf\u00e9\u201d workshop was held last October at the Nepean Sportsplex. Twenty people were chosen from more than 200 applications, submitted to Ottawa police by youth aged 13 to 24, by a selection panel of police, a youth-agency representative and a youth.Maddie Brown says she joined the committee because she wants to provide a connection between youth in Ottawa and the police.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go out to schools and do presentations, and kind of be the connection point,\u201d Brown says. \u201cBut there was never really a way to get that started, so when I read about the opportunity to join, I was like yay.\u201dJennifer Koivula, another committee member, says she would eventually like to pursue a career in law enforcement, so volunteering was a natural move.\u201cI do want a career in policing, that\u2019s what I\u2019m aiming for, and I know that a lot of youth are the people that I\u2019m going to be dealing with on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Koivula says. \u201cI want to learn to connect with them better, understand them better and overall make a difference.\u201dSince the committee\u2019s first meeting in June, its 20 members have been hard at work creating the group\u2019s image, raising awareness and being trained in public relations and how to deal with youth. They\u2019ve been developing their committee\u2019s image and mandate, while also trying to present themselves in an appealing way to the rest of Ottawa youth.With an annual budget of $4,000, the committee plans to continue creating awareness of the group throughout Ottawa, as well as promoting youth events in the city.",

    "body": "A proposal for the construction of barrier-free routes between two pathways along the Rideau Canal in Centretown has moved a step ahead after the city\u2019s accessibility advisory committee recently endorsed the plan.\r\rThe barrier-free ramps have been proposed to provide accessible links between the paths on the west side of the canal near Laurier Avenue and south of the Corktown Bridge to Waverley Street. Elizabeth Murphy, an engineer with the city\u2019s infrastructure services department, was part of the team that presented the proposal and says the aim was to have a network of pathways on both the east and west sides of the canal with more accessibility. \u201cWe are trying to provide a choice,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are trying to make it easy for people with disabilities to move about.\u201dCurrently there are two pathway systems between the canal and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The pathway parallel to the Rideau Canal is a 1.5-metre asphalt pathway that runs from the National Arts Centre to the Queensway. The pathway adjacent to Queen Elizabeth Drive is a four-metre multi-use pathway that extends from the Ottawa River Parkway westward and to Dow\u2019s Lake and Preston Street to the south. The pathways are separated by a vegetated embankment and sets of stairs connect them at different points. But that link only works for those with full mobility.According to the preliminary design that was presented to the accessibility advisory committee, the barrier-free connection would have a maximum slope of five per cent and would be located near an existing set of stairs to provide clear alternatives. The ramps which Murphy says meet all provincial standards are intended to provide multiple access points between the two pathways. The Ontario Association of Landscape Architects has carried out an extensive study of the plant material in the location where the ramps are proposed for construction. The design criteria mentioned in the preliminary plan outlines the aim to minimize impact to the adjacent landscape and \u201cto protect the existing high quality mature trees.\u201dCommittee member Helen Lenthall says she was happy to see the plan for the barrier-free ramps. \u201cIt has been 15 years trying to put it (in), so it is a long time coming,\u201d Lenthall says. \u201cAnd they are trying to make all the effort to make it inclusionary, so we are more than pleased in that sense, too.\u201dBut Bob Brown, another member of the committee, was not satisfied with the plan but said it is better than nothing. \u201cI would have liked to see something at the other side of Corktown bridge, but now you have to travel down 128 metres to be able to come back up, which is a fairly long piece,\u201d Brown says. \u201cIt was a really good idea, but I think you need something (else) at the Corktown bridge location as well.\u201dAccording to Murphy and her team, the ramps should improve the network of the multi-use pathways on the west side of the canal. The infrastructure services department is now working on a detailed design to bring back to council for approval. The city will also have to make an application to the NCC for federal design and land use approval. Murphy says that if all goes well, the accessibility ramps could be in place next spring. ",

This, combined with the increase in the number of immigrants in Ottawa, is what prompted the creation of the project, he says. From now on, the SCREEN project will organize diabetes-screening clinics for specific populations once or twice per year, he says.The first event on Oct. 26, the same day Ottawa Centre Liberal MPP Yasir Naqvi announced the funding, targeted the Latin American community by providing Spanish-speaking healthcare workers, Boulay says. About 90 patients attended the clinic.The next clinic, on Nov. 10, will serve the Somali population. Dates in late November and December will provide services for Punjabi and Nepalese immigrants.The SCREEN project identified these communities specifically by using a model called Projenesis, which was developed in London, Ont. to educate healthcare workers about providing diabetes care for high-risk ethnic groups, says Naqvi.The SCREEN project aims to break down cultural barriers that stop immigrants from having their diabetes diagnosed and treated, says Naqvi. There are two main barriers \u2013 language, and a lack of knowledge about preventing the disease, he says.Immigrants who don\u2019t speak English fluently may struggle to describe their symptoms, which prevents them from getting treatment. Also, some patients coming from less developed parts of the world may not have had access to good healthcare before and therefore don\u2019t know much about their own bodies, says Naqvi.Cultural differences, such as an unbalanced diet and limited physical activity, may also be what\u2019s putting these groups at higher risk, says SCREEN project co-ordinator Hashem Abdalla.",

The man behind a new national monument in Centretown that honours the sacrifices of animals in war says last Saturday\u2019s\u00a0 unveiling at Confederation Park was a \u201crewarding\u201d moment that \u201cexceeded all my expectations.\u201d\r\rThe monument was dedicated near the National War Memorial just a week before Remembrance Day as a tribute to the horses, dogs, pigeons and all other animals that have served Canada \u2013 and often died \u2013 during the First and Second World War and other conflicts.The memorial, placed beside the South African War Memorial in the downtown park at Laurier and Elgin, was unveiled after a three-year-long campaign by the Animals in War Dedication Committee. \u00a0\u201cDid you ever hear the expression that the planets of the universe were aligned? Well, they were. (That day) exceeded all my expectations,\u201d says Lloyd Swick, a Second World War veteran who also served in Korea, and who is chiefly responsible for getting the memorial made.He began the campaign three years ago when he attended a Remembrance Day service where he saw bronze figures depicting horses and soldiers straining to haul the artillery. \u201cHe felt that if those bronze figures (of the soldiers) could express it, they would want the animals to be remembered for the invaluable contribution they made and how they also helped to shape our country,\u201d says Shalindhi Perera, the media relations co-ordinator for the committee. Swick pitched the idea of the monument for animals at an annual meeting of the National Capital Commission, which later formed the committee to get the memorial built.NCC spokeswoman Denise LeBlanc says the location of the memorial was carefully chosen to be near a Confederation Park memorial to the South African War because Canada supplied 50,000 horses for mounted troops in that conflict \u2013 a war in which Canada won its first battle on foreign land under British command.The memorial, created by David Clendining, consists of three bronze plaques atop three boulders, with each plaque displaying animals working alongside their human comrades. \u00a0Walking into the park, the memorial is difficult to miss. There is a dog wearing a medical kit, overseeing three jagged boulders. In Swick\u2019s words, \u201cthe cruelty of war\u201d is seen in two pictures of men, horses and mules straining to pull ammunition and artillery through huge craters of mud and sewage created by constant shelling. The mud is as deep as the horses\u2019 knees and the bodies of the humans are bent, tense, and strained as they attempt to push the wheels forward. The ammunition pulled by the mules almost matches the size of each mule.Another plaque, Swick says, shows the \u201clove and bonding between a man and his animal.\u201d It is a scene that often occurred in wartime \u2013 a soldier clutching the head of his injured horse. The soldier is seen kissing it and whispering goodbye. Swick recalled a story of a Mongolian Mule that was in Korea with the U.S. Marines who served there in the early 1950s alongside Swick and other Canadians. Over a five-day period of the battle, the mule, named Reckless, carried some five tonnes of ammunition from the base, up a rugged terrain mountain path, to the front lines. On its return trip, Reckless carried wounded soldiers on a gurney attached to its back.\u201cHere\u2019s the trick - she did this unescorted,\u201d Swick says. \u201cCan you imagine the men they would have to have to carry all that ammunition?\u201d Reckless was twice wounded and honored with\u00a0 a decoration.Other honoured animals include Simon the Cat. He suffered severe injuries on the HMS Amethyst when it was shelled off the coast of Korea by Chinese communist forces. Simon, according to the committee\u2019s website, caught rats that were depleting the crew\u2019s dwindling rations while the ship was held hostage. Perera says she is touched by\u00a0 stories about canaries used during war to detect noxious gases in mine shafts.She hopes after attending the Remembrance Day ceremony people will place their poppies on the animal dedication.\u201cI would love to see poppies left at the Animals in War Dedication, as a reminder to never forget how animals gave all they had to serve their human comrades. They are truly war heroes and now we have a way to remember their contribution,\u201d she says.Swick says he is grateful for all those who helped him achieve the goal, including Laureen Harper, wife of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Veteran Affairs Canada, the NCC, and Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, who declared that Animals in War Day will be marked every year in Ottawa on Nov. 3.",

    "body": "A proposal to transform Metcalfe Street into a two-way street has residents concerned about traffic in Centretown.\r\rThe change is part of a Centretown Community Design Plan that will be presented to the Planning Committee on Dec. 11.The plan concerns transportation, land use, green spaces and building heights in the mid-Centretown area. It has been developed over the last three years in collaboration with various Centretown associations, including the Centretown Citizens Community Association. The idea of turning Metcalfe Street into a two-way street is not very recent, says Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes. \u201cThat\u2019s been talked about for many years, about 25 years actually.\u201dBut CCCA vice-president Robert Dekker still isn\u2019t sold on the idea. \u201cThis is a concern to us because with one-way streets we can anticipate traffic but by making the streets two-way you\u2019re actually going to create a busier street for a longer period of time,\u201d Dekker says.\u201cWe know that Metcalfe\u2019s peak period is the morning when people are going into the city while O\u2019Connor is going to be busy in the afternoon when people are leaving. Now what happens is that you\u2019re going to have these streets busier throughout the day.\u201dHe is also concerned that these changes might have an impact on other Centretown streets. \u201cElgin is a good example of a street that moves traffic well, but is Elgin going to be affected because they are changing the way other streets change? Elgin can\u2019t take much more traffic,\u201d Dekker says.The design plan outlines a way to create \u201ca good balance between walking, cycling, public transit and vehicular traffic.\u201d The idea is \u201cto improve the streets environment for all users\u201d and to \u201cimprove safety for pedestrians and cyclists\u201d by slowing the traffic.Holmes says she believes the change should be considered\u00a0 though it might be difficult to get people on board with the idea. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like change, those who live on two-way streets want it to stay two-way streets and those who live on one-way streets want it to stay one-way streets so this would take a lot of public consultation,\u201d she says.Despite his concerns, Dekker says the plan would change the Centretown environment for the better. \u201cI think we are on the right track, I think the community design plan applies very nicely. What we want to see is the creation of a more mobile city whether it\u2019s for transit or pedestrians or cycling while respecting that people still need their cars to get into town,\u201d Dekker says.",

    "body": "Exotic ancient China; powerful, feuding warriors; a devious brothel proprietress. A generous helping of magic-realism \u00e0 la wuxia tradition (think Crouching Tiger or Hero). Top-tier Hollywood talent. The cinematic debut of a well-known creative voice, Wu-Tang Clan frontman RZA.\r\rTo look at the elements, the potential is there. The Man with the Iron Fists\u00a0Directed by RZA,Starring RZA, Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, Cung Le, Rick Yune, David Bautista But The Man With The Iron Fists, which RZA co-wrote with Hostel\u2019s Eli Roth \u2013 that might have something to do with the sheer amount of mutilating violence \u2013 is a colossal misfire, amounting to nothing more than a soup of references devoid of cohesive storytelling let alone any deeper meaning or emotion, a sort of amateur Tarantino flick made in the kung-fu sandbox by someone with lots of stock in computer-generated blood rendering software.The plot takes a page from the Smokin\u2019 Aces playbook, establishing a bunch of colourful characters and then setting them on a violent collision course with an eye for maximum fireworks but not much else besides.RZA plays a blacksmith who forges weapons for the usual evil warlord types because with enough money he can rescue the woman he loves from servitude in the local brothel. When the very same warlords steal a trove of government money and begin shedding blood \u2013 what really counts is that they hire a giant, metal-skinned henchman to beat up their enemies \u2013 he sees an opportunity to redeem himself.Unfortunately, the blacksmith \u2013 named Thaddeus and given a brief, black-and-white back-story as a freed slave \u2013 is a mumbling absentee of a protagonist the audience has scarcely any reason to identify with. He has the slightest screen presence of all the major players and the least memorable combat scenes despite ostensibly headlining the film.Meanwhile, a lecherous British soldier (Russell Crowe, who is having more fun than anyone playing drunk for much of the movie) and the brothel\u2019s cunning madam (cunning because it is Lucy Liu in the role, though she deserves much better) figure mysteriously into the approaching confrontation.The long and the short of it \u2013 and its consuming incoherence is certainly more majestic drawn out over 96 minutes on an enormous screen \u2013 is that the storytellers wanted to arrive at an epic confrontation between good guys and bad guys but had no idea how to set it up effectively.Then it happens, then it\u2019s over, and the audience realizes that at no point in this fragmentary jumble did anything seem to matter one whit.Every possible clich\u00e9 is trotted out for the camera like a lamb to the slaughter, from large-scale plot devices down to lines of dialogue that could have been written by thumbing through a Rolodex of movie aphorisms. This is homage roughly to the same extent that it could be considered parody \u2013 completely inept is what it really is, primarily (one can surmise) due to the lack of a director effective and knowledgeable in that role. Instead, RZA tosses ideas at the screen haphazardly, hoping by odds alone some of it will stick.For instance, a recurrent steam-punk aesthetic meshes awkwardly with the backdrop of period China, their inconsistency complicated further by the intermittent, hyper-violent fantasy elements and topped off with a highly incongruous soundtrack of heavy-duty Wu-Tang hip-hop.No expense was spared, you have to give them that much: Oscar-winner Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu are on hand to support RZA, and the martial arts talent includes Byron Mann (Street Fighter), Rick Yune (The Fast and the Furious), UFC\u2019s Cung Le, and hulking former professional wrestler David Batista, with choreography by Cory Yuen (The Transporter).But since the finished movie plays like a slipshod grindhouse/blaxploitation remix of RZA\u2019s favourite shelf of vintage kung-fu films, which is to say like an unbearably bad spoof, it is difficult to pick out redeeming qualities from amid the muddle of vacuous money-shots.Bearing similarity on a number of levels to Zack Snyder\u2019s disappointing Sucker Punch \u2013 including that, amid all manner of derivative rubbish, it evinces just a bit of nice cinematography and a few good ideas \u2013 this is the kind of ego-driven artistic brainchild that should never be allowed to come to term.",

The bridge is to be located near the corner of Carling Avenue and Preston Street.Currently, the bridge measures four metres wide, says Robert Grimwood, the city\u2019s project manager for sustainable transportation. This measurement includes a walkway for pedestrians and cyclists to share, which received a \u201csatisfactory response\u201d from the Centretown community through online feedback on the project\u2019s web page.Darwin says that having both pedestrians and cyclists sharing the walkway \u201cis a recipe for disaster\u201d when taking into account the turning of the bicycles and people hurrying to catch the train. Darwin asks for the bridge to be seven metres wide.Space is an issue, says Hans Moor, president of Citizens for Safe Cycling. His concern, like Darwin\u2019s, is the cyclists having enough room to manoeuvre around pedestrians at the crossing and on the walkway.The City of Ottawa has a standard measurement for bridge construction of three metres, which can then be changed if necessary. Grimwood explains that Corktown Bridge is five metres wide and has plenty of pedestrian and cyclist traffic. He stresses that a final decision regarding the bridge has yet to be made.Grimwood responded to Darwin \u201cwith concern and interest in [his] letter\u201d. However, this is not the first time Darwin has mentioned the \u201cone size fits all\u201d standard for sidewalks being a problem in the city. Darwin and the DCA cited a study on pedestrian volumes in order to determine how wide sidewalks should be.Grimwood says that Darwin\u2019s wider walkway suggestion is more about segregating cyclists and pedestrians. He adds that the walkways are \u201cmulti-paths\u201d, meaning that pedestrians and cyclists can both use the path.While Darwin understands the \u201cmulti-path\u201d, he still believes there will be conflict between the pedestrians and cyclists sharing the path. \u201cIt is only just possible for cyclists to pass each other, or a pedestrian and cyclist, but not for crowds or multiple users,\u201d he says.By adding the extra three metres to the bridge, Darwin says the expected traffic and turning of the bicycles will happen safely and efficiently, so as to encourage active transportation and transit usage.Grimwood says that development for the bridge is still in discussion and the functional design for the bridge will be determined by the end of this year.\u201cWe aren't asking for a Cadillac bridge,\u201d says Darwin, \u201cbut the city's current proposal for a econo-bridge will fall short of demand as soon as it is built.\u201d ",

For officials with the Centretown and the Somerset West community health centres, the report promotes their citizen-driven design and brings a hope for increased financial support. While the Centretown Community Health Centre on Cooper Street recently received nearly $800,000 from the Ontario government to deliver a new diabetes-prevention program, it and the Somerset West Community Health Centre on Eccles Street in Chinatown have both been seeking more resources to sustain and expand their services.The Canadian Index of Wellbeing report \u201chelps us make our case to the people who fund us,\u201d says Christina Marchant, director of community health promotion and early years at the Centretown centre. The report praises Canadian community health centres for addressing a range of determinants of health \u2013 factors such as education, housing, and language barriers \u2013 that limit citizens\u2019 access to health care. Instead of just caring for the sick, community health centres aim to prevent illnesses through building communities and educating them about their health. Earlier research done by organizations such as the Bruyere Research Institute also promotes the strategy as an effective, all-encompassing approach to health care.\u201cThe secret to success is, in a nutshell, combining primary care with health promotion and community development services,\u201d says Mary MacNutt, manager of policy and communications at the Association of Ontario Health Centres, which represents community health centres provincially.For the Somerset centre, this means tailoring health services to meet the needs of a community of newcomers. According to the centre\u2019s executive director, Jack McCarthy, visitors in Centretown\u2019s Chinatown neighbourhood can now receive flu shots from Mandarin-speaking health workers. To keep such centres running at their full potential, the Canadian Index of Wellbeing report calls for more federal and provincial funding.Marchant says that although financial support has been stable for existing health centres, there is always more to be done.Right now, the Centretown Community Health Centre is struggling with space, she says. They often hold group programming off-site, because \u201cthere is just no room.\u201d The report also draws attention to the need for more community health centres. There are 73 centres in Ontario, with six operating in Ottawa. Still, this means only about four per cent of the provincial population is receiving services, MacNutt says.\u201cBecause there are not that many of them in Ontario,\u201d she says, \u201cnot many people know about it, so they don\u2019t even know to ask for them.\u201dReports like this one help to get the word out, she says.McCarthy is not anticipating a \u201csurge of funding,\u201d but he says he is comforted by the recognition the centres are receiving.Bay Coun. Mark Taylor, chair of the city\u2019s community and protective services committee, remains hopeful about the provincial government\u2019s response to the report. With Ontario in the midst of choosing of a new premier, he says, there are bound to be new priorities. \u201c[It\u2019s] not a bad time to get (the report) out in front of the \u2026decision-makers provincially to have them take a look at it\u2026and think about what it potentially could mean for them as they start to formulate their budget.\u201d",

They believe the herbivore was about six metres long and weighed more than two tons. The initial discovery was made in 2003 by Dr. Michael Ryan of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and Dr. David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum. The paleontologists discovered skull fragments that were sitting on a museum shelf since being unearthed in Alberta in 1958.Ryan and Evans found other pieces several years later in an old plaster field jacket.They published their research in the October 2012 issue of the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. Dr. Kieran Shepherd, curator of palaeobiology for the Museum of Nature, says he anticipates the discovery will draw researchers to the museum.\u201cIt\u2019s a new species, a new holotype, the first of its kind, so it\u2019s a very important specimen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a full dinosaur, so it won\u2019t go on public display, but it means a lot for behind-the-scenes research.\u201dHe says the discovery is already changing what paleontologists previously believed about ceratops dinosaurs.

    "body": "Despite concern that many of its recommendations will never be implemented \u2014 including proposals for more green space in downtown Ottawa \u2014 a finalized version of the Centretown Community Design Plan has been released after undergoing extensive review by local community organizations. \r\rThe plan, formerly known as the Mid-Centretown design plan, has been going through revisions for more than two years. It calls for increased building heights, more bike lanes, improved pedestrian routes, and a revitalization of the area\u2019s parks and green space.In spite of its ambitious goals, the plan has received criticism from municipal and community representatives \u2014 including Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes \u2014 who say building new parks in the midst of downtown development will prove difficult if not impossible.Holmes recently told the Ottawa Citizen that land prices in the downtown area \u2014 largely as a result of earlier planning decisions permitting taller buildings in certain parts of Centretown \u2014 have \u201ctripled,\u201d meaning landowners will be determined to sell for huge profits to developers rather than striking deals with the city to create small parks.She pointed to a proposed park at Bank and Gilmour streets \u2014 to be called Derby Lane Square \u2014 as one idea unlikely to come to fruition.The area included in the development plan stretches from Kent Street in the west to Elgin Street in the east. The Queensway marks the southern boundary for the area, with the high rises of downtown at Gloucester Street to the north.George Dark, the Toronto-based urban designer behind much of the design, has stated that the goal of the project has always been to take into account Centretown\u2019s diverse population and unique needs. But Jordan Charbonneau, president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, says the design lacks a comprehensive plan for change, especially with regard to the proposed improvements to the area\u2019s \u201csmall but significant\u201d pieces of green space. \u201cWe are very pleased to see the strength in the vision for enhancing and increasing green space in its many forms, but what is most important is what is done with this plan,\u201d says Charbonneau. The extensive green space plan calls for two entirely new parks, as well as a number of smaller \u201cparkettes\u201d to be scattered across the downtown. Meanwhile, significant numbers of trees along Metcalfe, Somerset, Gladstone, and Catherine streets would create \u201ca more connected green system\u201d for Centretown residents, according to the plan. The city has already seen significant redevelopment of its parks, with $2.5 million set aside for improvements to parks at the beginning of 2012. But Holmes says developing green space in an area this dense can be difficult.Bonnie Mabee, chair of the CCCA\u2019s green space committee, shares Holmes\u2019 concerns that implementation of the plan will eventually fall short. \u201cIt is key to have a long-term, coordinated, year-by-year outline of park and green space planning,\u201d says Mabee. \u201cThis is a tough sell to council.\u201dThe plan is to be presented to city council\u2019s planning committee on Dec. 11.",

Hoang I have always had a fascination with other cultures and the people that define them, even sub-cultures within our own society that present various aspects of behaviour we may not be aware of. When I travel, it\u2019s the rituals and practices of the local people that I enjoy more than the scenery and hotel that I\u2019m in. \r\rThere\u2019s nothing more fascinating to me than having an opportunity to watch police culture. I am part of a selected few who hold a ticket, the badge, into one of life\u2019s most interesting cultures. Every day I do my best to blend in like a ticket holder showing up late for a show, quiet, trying not to disturb the rest of the audience as I stumble to find my seat.I watch and make note of the various songs and dance that separate police culture from the rest of society. Some of the acts I\u2019ve observed are simply inspiring, while others are less desirable. But the beauty of life has always been the opportunity to become better.Recently, I attended a lecture by Dr. Brian Goldman, a highly successful emergency physician at Toronto\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital for more than 20 years.\u00a0 The title of his seminar, \u201cDoctors make mistakes \u2013 Can we talk about it?\u201d immediately caught my attention.Over the next 30 minutes, I came to the conclusion that I was watching a fellow culture observer. Dr. Goldman had recognized that Canadian doctors hated talking about their mistakes and that the medical field will cease to evolve until doctors put aside their egos and support each other in sharing crucial information to stop future mistakes.That\u2019s when I realized, we police officers suffer from the same symptoms. When was the last time a police officer told a member of the public that they made a mistake? It would be even more rare for a police officer to share that they have made mistakes with one another. We all suffer from the same ego-driven culture that emergency doctors, military, and many other high stress jobs face on a daily basis.It starts as a recruit, when I made my first mistake and was teased relentlessly by fellow recruits. Followed by the police instructors who keep yelling, \u201cA mistake on the street could be your last!\u201d None of which promoted an environment of sharing your oversights.The next few years of a rookie\u2019s career are filled with overwhelming information, experiences and expectations; nobody wants to make a mistake. In such a demanding field with mounting public pressure for accountability, I\u2019m scared of what would happen if everyone knew the mistakes I made. But I made them and still make them today.If it starts with training, then that\u2019s where I\u2019ll begin my work; I gave a lecture at a recruit training session called \u201cHuman Police Officers\u201d where I spoke about the challenges of managing a personal life, public accountability, and making mistakes. I shared my personal experiences and tried to convince future police officers to support each other while promoting a positive work environment.I explained that some officers, including supervisors, will overreact and treat them poorly after admitting to a mistake, but that good leaders have always allowed others to fail without ever being a failure. Lastly, for what it was worth, our officers would earn my admiration if they could sacrifice their own egos and share a story that made them human and reduce the competitive corporate culture that has become toxic in many work places.",

Members of Ottawa\u2019s M\u00e9tis community joined the Ottawa police to celebrate M\u00e9tis culture and the legacy of leader Louis Riel, in a ceremony held at police headquarters today on the anniversary of Riel\u2019s execution.\u00a0  \r\rRiel was a M\u00e9tis leader in the Canadian Prairies who led resistance movements against the Canadian government, seeking to protect M\u00e9tis rights and culture. For his resistance efforts, Riel was executed on the charge of high treason on Nov. 16, 1885. Riel is regarded today as a Father of Confederation and as the Father of Manitoba. He is seen as an important historical figure by Canada\u2019s M\u00e9tis and Francophone communities.Nov. 16 is recognized in many communities across Canada as Louis Riel Day. M\u00e9tis elder Jo MacQuarrie said observing Louis Riel Day is important to the M\u00e9tis in Ontario as a reminder of their history. \u201cRiel\u2019s only crime was that he defended the rights of his people, our people, the M\u00e9tis,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough he fought for M\u00e9tis rights in the west, his resistance had repercussions in Ontario as well. We were labeled traitors and for generations, our culture was forced underground. We became the forgotten people.\u201dMacQuarrie said the M\u00e9tis people have taken up the mantle of Louis Riel and worked to affirm their rights. She said raising the M\u00e9tis national flag on Louis Riel Day affirms the M\u00e9tis as a proud people and a founding group in Canada. As part of the Ottawa Police Service\u2019s Flag and Banner program, the flag will be on display at the Elgin Street police station until Nov. 19. This is the fourth year the police have held a celebration. M\u00e9tis culture was also on display through traditional dances, performed by M\u00e9tis jigger Daryle Gardipy. Insp.

But it isn\u2019t a ruse: with 007 atop a moving train fighting for possession of a hard drive containing classified personnel data, MI6 head M (Judi Dench) orders field agent Eve (Naomie Harris) to take a difficult shot, and it is Bond who falls.\r\rCue Adele with a theme song every bit as much at pains to achieve classic Bond status as the opening. And it is a success on both counts, even if the action doesn\u2019t top the Parkour-infused teaser that introduced Daniel Craig as Bond in Casino Royale. Skyfall \u00a0Directed by Sam MendesStarring Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Albert Finney, Ben WhishawWhen Bond resurfaces, MI6 is contending with the new oversight of security committee chairman Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), who wants to oust M, while facing an escalating crisis resulting from the leaking of those all-important personnel files by an unknown mastermind with a vendetta against the agency.Backed up by Eve, tantalized by a mysterious beauty named S\u00e9v\u00e9rine (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Lim Marlohe), and modestly equipped by his fledgling Q Branch quartermaster (Ben Whishaw), Bond pursues answers to the island lair of cyber-terrorist Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), formerly an agent under M\u2019s command.Almost certainly the loveliest Bond outing to date, Skyfall is as visually arresting as one might expect of a film bearing the names of director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins.But most notable of all is the overarching return to form after the franchise faltered with the joyless, incoherent Quantum of Solace. By contrast, Skyfall is packed with energy and humour, still exhibiting unabashed illogic but on a smaller scale and mostly to keep the plot motoring along like a vintage Aston Martin (which does make a crucial reappearance).The Bond girls are finally Bond girls again, though \u2014 true to the involvement of Judi Dench \u2014 they are not all cut from the cloth of helpless passivity. And Silva as antagonist, particularly in the capable hands of Javier Bardem, harks back enthusiastically to the flamboyant villainy that characterized classic Bond.With Daniel Craig at last fully inhabiting the mantle of 007, it is fitting that Skyfall offers some novel hints at the life and youth of James Bond, illuminating his relationship with M and throwing Silva\u2019s opposite nature into relief.Skyfall Lodge, Bond\u2019s childhood home and the setting for the film\u2019s final act\u2014in which the glorious old Albert Finney outshines everyone else playing the caretaker\u2014makes for a wholly unexpected contrivance that turns the climax into a home invasion thrill-ride that might have capped off a Christopher Nolan remake of Straw Dogs.With Daniel Craig signed up for at least two more adventures, forget Quantum of Solace, Bond is back.",

Residents driving in or out of Centretown on Bronson Avenue will have to contend with an increased police presence until as late as March, says Coun. Marianne Wilkinson, chair of Ottawa's transportation committee.\r\rAt the committee\u2019s last meeting, Wilkinson announced Ottawa police will be increasing its presence immediately along Bronson Avenue between the crosswalk at Brewer Park and Carleton University and Holmwood Avenue. Meanwhile, city staff is researching the most effective solutions for making Bronson safer for all who use the route to get in or out of the downtown core.After the death of Krista Johnson, a cyclist killed on Bronson near Carleton University in October, citizens and citizen groups across Ottawa have been pushing city councillors to find ways to make Bronson safer for cyclists and pedestrians.Until enough data on traffic patterns on Bronson is collected, Wilkinson says Ottawa police will be strictly enforcing the current speed limit. They have already set up radar trailers along Bronson to try to make drivers more aware of how fast they\u2019re travelling.Capital Ward Coun. David Chernushenko, responded to the public pressure early on. He proposed an immediate reduction of the speed limit on Bronson between Brewer Park and Holmwood Avenue, which is currently 60 and 70 km/h, to 50.\u201cWe know a lot of things about speed, there\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s a saying out there that\u2019s sort of universally used, which is \u2018speed kills,\u201d says Chernushenko. Hans Moor, president of Citizens for Safe Cycling, says he wants the city to make a few changes to Bronson. The first is to lower speed limits and narrow the current street to change the feel of Bronson Avenue from a four-lane highway to a city street.Another suggestion Moor has for convincing traffic to slow down on Bronson is to redesign the onramps leading from Heron Road onto Bronson and the onramps leading from Riverside Drive onto Bronson. The idea is to make the curve of the onramps sharper so drivers have little choice but to slow down while driving onto Bronson.When Chernushenko brought his proposal to the roads and transportation committee, many councillors voiced concerns over the tangible good a speed limit change on Bronson might actually bring compared with any negative effects it might cause.The issue, Wilkinson says, is not so much the speed limit, but rather the overall design and feel of Bronson Avenue while you\u2019re driving on that stretch of road.\u201cWhen a road is wide and open as it is when you\u2019re getting towards Carleton as you\u2019re coming from the south, cars tend to go fast,\u201d Wilkinson says. \u201cAnd when it gets congested in narrower lanes they tend to slow down.\u00a0 So slowing the speed limit won\u2019t cause a lot of people to drive slower.\u201d The committee decided to refer the question of whether or not to lower the Bronson speed limit to 50 km/h to city staff. Wilkinson says there just isn\u2019t enough data collected to make such drastic changes to Bronson with the sense of urgency Chernushenko had originally advocated for.She says the average speed a car travels on Bronson on that stretch is 84 km/h. What Bronson really needs is a new design, which could take years to fully complete. No matter what solutions city staff comes up with, they have to be workable within the current width of Bronson. After hearing from a representative of the city staff research group, councillors at the committee meeting agreed that Bronson cannot be feasibly widened without first purchasing many of the properties bordering the street, which would cost too much and affect too many people.Wilkinson says the full report on Bronson traffic, complete with recommendations, should be presented at the February or March city council meeting.",

On the museum\u2019s website, the event is advertised as a \u201cdate night venue\u201d for adults and Iburg echoed that sentiment. She says there is a difference in going alone to a museum and going on a date to an event like this.For people, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s not about them and the artifact, it\u2019s about them and the person they came with and that they have this experience together.\u201d\u201cIt does replace going out to a bar or restaurant or movie, what have you, but in a way that you\u2019re having an experience that is different from all of those things,\u201d she says.Rather than just trying to get more people through the door, the event seems to be part of a larger trend to re-invent museums, says Audrey Vermette, director of programming at the Canadian Museums Association. \u201cI think museums are indeed trying to find innovative ways to get people through, but not just through the door to visit but to get involved with the museums,\" she says. \"(They) are really becoming more community centres, at the heart of their community, rather than these old dusty places.\u201dThis won\u2019t be the first time the Museum of Nature has hosted parties. The museum previously held a Smirnoff Red Door party, an event Beckel says inspired the museum to look at how to get young professionals to visit again. This time she says she\u2019s hoping people will come back more often. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that we\u2019ll develop a following of young professionals who think it\u2019s fun and cool and interesting to hang out at the (museum) once a month, and that they\u2019ll continue to come back,\u201d she said.And if, while searching for true love under the gaze of a 65-million-year-old dinosaur skeleton, they happen to learn something, then that\u2019s just an added bonus.",

    "body": "A recent decision by the City of Ottawa to put a Preston Street development on hold is an example of the city\u2019s \u201chodge-podge,\u201d ad hoc approach to intensification, experts say. \r\rJohn Herbert, executive director of the Greater Ottawa Home Builders\u2019 Association, says that since the city introduced new intensification policies with its official plan in 2003, a lack of zoning bylaws pit industry against community associations in what seems like a confusing and \u201cnever-ending saga.\u201d\u201cThey have this vision in the official plan of intensification but no zoning bylaw for industry and community associations to actually understand,\u201d Herbert says. Claridge Homes submitted a request for a zoning bylaw amendment last May to allow for a high-rise condominium tower on Preston Street. The site in question, a condo development at 505 Preston, was set to be Ottawa\u2019s tallest building at 42 storeys. The city will likely review the request early next year. But despite the hold on this development, there are a number of other sites in the area that have recently been given the go-ahead by the city. Another condo tower by Claridge Homes at 500 Preston Street and a tower by Richcraft Homes on Carling Avenue are underway. An Ashcroft Homes two-tower condo development on Champagne Avenue was approved by the city\u2019s planning committee last week. Eric Darwin, vice-president of the Dalhousie Community Association, says he was surprised by the city\u2019s decision to delay the 505 Preston St. proposal. \u201cThe impression we got from all the city planners is they were all enthused about this,\u201d Darwin says. \u201cAnd suddenly the city has decided after all this time they\u2019re going to put a hold on it.\u201dBut John Smit, the city\u2019s manager of development review, says the city cannot continue with the Preston Street proposal without a community design plan \u2013 a long-term plan for neighbourhood development. Ottawa has been working on such a plan for the Carling-Bayview area, which includes Preston Street, for years. It is intended to give an overall framework to new development in the neighbourhood. Smit says with the number of applications coming in for development and without a plan, the city has to look at each application individually and consider how each would affect the community. \u201cLooking at that significant of a change in that area,\u201d Smit says, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to try to get a handle on how all of these different initiatives will fit into a larger whole.\u201dJeff Leiper, a member of the Hintonburg Community Association, an area of the city that has seen a lot of recent intensification, says the city\u2019s process for approving development is too quick and doesn\u2019t seem to have set standards. He says this leaves communities uncertain about what sort of buildings will go up, how tall they\u2019ll be and where they will be located. \u201cIt\u2019s being approved on an ad hoc basis about really tall towers and that makes a lot of people uncomfortable,\u201d Leiper says. \u201cIt is proceeding far too quickly,\" Leiper adds. \"Without a plan in place we\u2019re just nervous the council is approving without thinking about the long-term.\u201dLeiper says it\u2019s positive that the city is putting the Claridge rezoning application on hold and hopes the same will happen for developments in Hintonburg.But Herbert says the issue is bigger than just single community design plans being completed in Ottawa neighbourhoods.\u201cThey still need to go back, start from scratch and create a new comprehensive zoning bylaw for the City of Ottawa,\u201d Hebert says. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that is going to solve this problem in the medium and long term.\u201dSomerset Ward Coun.

    "body": "Time and time again, Ottawa\u2019s public transportation system causes its users more frustration than necessary. And OC Transpo\u2019s at it again. The latest fiasco to make headlines in the city concerns hybrid buses.\r\rRecently, the city announced that it had made a mistake investing in its 170 hybrid buses, an initial investment of more than $600,000 for each bus, and will be moving to convert them back to diesel buses instead.The problem with these hybrid buses, the city says, is that they are costing more money than they are actually saving. The hybrid buses run on recharged electric batteries and were purchased in 2008 to save on fuel costs. Since then, these buses have cost the city $100,000 more than their diesel counterparts. In addition, they\u2019ve contributed to an extra $1-million tab for the costs of diesel fuel and $7 million for replacing batteries. This extra cost is because the hybrids require frequent stops and breaks to recharge their batteries, and OC Transpo is mostly using them on long-distance routes, like from downtown to Kanata via transitway. It makes sense, then, that the hybrids would end up costing more because they are not being utilized in routes that maximize their efficiency. The transitway that connects the downtown core to far-reaching places has fewer stops and requires longer times between stops, which makes it difficult for the buses to recharge on these routes. To be fair, we cannot fault the current administration for this blunder \u2013 it was the previous administration that purchased the buses without calculating the real expenses for this system. There were several warnings about the hybrids before they were purchased, but the previous administration ignored these and went ahead with the experiment anyway. So it's no surprise that we see these problems surfacing now. But the current administration is on the hook for figuring out how to solve this blunder, and they haven't come up with any effective solutions that would cost taxpayers the least amount of money. \u00a0Now, the city supposedly wants to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to convert these hybrid buses back to diesel. This makes no sense. Instead of spending more money, why not just switch the hybrid buses to routes that would be more efficient for them, and use diesel buses for longer routes? This would allow the hybrids to do the job they were purchased for in the first place \u2013 save the city money and fuel. This simple solution seems to not have been considered by city officials \u2013 and it should be.Ottawa likes its hybrid buses. They give the city a feel of being environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient. Scrapping the entire project without considering other alternatives to make it work is simply disappointing and does not have the cost-effectiveness that the city wants. It\u2019s true that hybrid buses have the potential to lower the costs of diesel and increase efficiency in the process, but that depends on how they\u2019re used. We need to find a better use for them, and not just throw them away. We\u2019ve spent enough money on this project already. Let\u2019s figure out how to fix it without spending more. ",

    "body": "The death of a 27-year-old cyclist last month aimed the spotlight at safety on Bronson Avenue, but the city needs to do more than just review speed limits to prevent another tragedy on one of the capital\u2019s busiest roads.\r\rWhether or not speed was a factor in the death of Krista Johnson is murky, as she was biking north in the southbound lane when she was struck on Oct. 18. But her death reopened the discussion about the ongoing traffic and safety issues on Bronson Avenue, which make it a dangerous area for residents of Centretown, the Glebe and Old Ottawa South.\u201cThe tragedy starts a different kind of conversation,\u201d says Rob Dekker, spokesman for the Centretown Citizens Community Association. \u201cIt changes the urgency. Now we have to make sure we change faster, make sure the right parameters are in place to prevent any further death or injury along that street.\u201dIn the wake of the tragedy Coun. David Chernushenko proposed a reduction in the speed limit on the stretch of road near Holmwood Avenue where Johnson was hit. In early November, the city launched a safety review of the entire street. But it will take more than a reduction in speed to make Bronson safe for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians\u2014Bronson Avenue needs a fundamental redesign.The street is one of the most heavily used thoroughfares in Ottawa, an arterial route that is one of the few north-south corridors for drivers coming from outside of downtown. The speed limit for much of Bronson Avenue is 70 km/h, though it drops to 60 km/h for the stretch just north of Carleton University. But the limits are routinely ignored, with speeds above 80 km/h distressingly common, as city staff reported at a meeting of the transportation committee on Nov. 7. At that same meeting, Coun. David Chernushenko proposed a 10 km/h reduction for the area of Bronson north of Carleton. Although his efforts are admirable, the current speed limit isn\u2019t being respected even with the threat of financial loss\u2014a few more tickets, even dozens more, won\u2019t change the way people move.For more evidence, look to King Edward Avenue. After the completion of a six-year reconstruction project that began in 2005, the six-lane outlet from the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge is a wide-open paradise for speed demons. Despite a posted speed limit of 40 km/h, local safety advocates on the King Edward Task Force have measured cars, trucks, and buses reaching regular speeds of 70 km/h. The heavy heads of coffee-starved commuters turn into heavy feet on their daily commutes to and from work.Like King Edward, it\u2019s the design of Bronson itself that\u2019s the issue. Only physical changes will have any effect on the way traffic flows. The six-lane section south of Carleton is not the problem, but as the road narrows to four lanes north of the Rideau Canal, traffic begins to pack together. Despite the close quarters, speed barely drops as cars plow through to Carling Avenue and beyond. Pedestrians and cyclists have little room to maneuver, and it\u2019s only a matter of time until the next collision.Dekker says King Edward and Bronson were designed before city engineers had an understanding of the way people move in the 21st\u00a0 century.\u201cThey\u2019re not designed for safety, they\u2019re designed to move as many cars as they can,\u201d he says. \u201cThat might have been okay 20 years ago before we had the types of pedestrian and bicycle traffic that we have. Our modes of transportation are changing rapidly and we need to make sure everyone can travel safe.\u201dYou have to move people, that\u2019s a fact,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you do it a little slower by design, you can get away with a narrower road. If you have traffic speeds of 70, 80, even 90 km/h like we\u2019ve seen, you can\u2019t have cyclists. It\u2019s like cycling on the Queensway, you\u2019ve had to be crazy.\u201dNarrowing the road and putting in a segregated lane for cyclists would go a long way towards reducing speeds on Bronson Avenue. Shrinking the road from four lanes to two in each direction would force speeders to slow down and merge, but putting the brakes on speeding would snarl traffic on an already packed road.Traffic jams on Bronson Avenue, however, are a small price to pay if lives can be saved. And traffic jams might also encourage more people to use alternate methods of travel such as cycling, especially when mounted riders whizz by during a Friday afternoon slowdown. Speed kills, but speed limits don\u2019t save lives. To prevent another tragedy, we have to rebuild Bronson Avenue.",

He reminded Americans that democracy isn\u2019t just about heading to the polls once every few years. \r\r\u201cThe role of citizens in our democracy does not end with your vote,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s never been about what can be done for us.\u201dGranted, it\u2019s probably just another way of saying that volunteers for the Democratic party shouldn\u2019t stop advocating just because the election is over. But Obama did touch on an important point and Canadians would do well to take heed. On many levels, Canadian politics is more open to citizen-based pressure than the American system, where corporate money has become a fixture on all levels. Canadian citizens, whether they put much stock in electoral politics or not, have a better chance of influencing the direction of policy.On Nov. 26, byelections are scheduled in three Canadian ridings: Durham in Ontario, Victoria in B.C., and Calgary Centre. In Victoria, environmental issues, specifically waste management, have tremendous importance. It\u2019s one of the few ridings where the Green Party is polling better than the Liberals. It\u2019s also located next to Green Party Leader Elizabeth May\u2019s Saanich-Gulf Islands riding. \u201cI think we are going to win this seat,\u201d says Don Galloway, Victoria Green Party candidate. \u201cAnd the fact that we\u2019re going to win it is going to change the political landscape in Canada.\u201dThe Greens\u2019 success in Victoria isn\u2019t just a result of public opinion. It was made possible by numerous civil society groups that helped put ecological issues at the forefront of local politics. For example, the Association for Responsible and Environmentally Sustainable Sewage Treatment is one of many advocacy groups that voiced it\u2019s opinion about the future of sewage treatment in Victoria. The city is set to build a nearly $1-billion sewage treatment plant in the next few years. The association, among others, notes that the project will cost too much, block access to the waterfront and carry a slew of environmental issues of its own. The debate is firmly in the public sphere. Now, all the candidates in the Victoria riding are taking heed. Murray Rankin, the New Democrat candidate, is in favour of the sewage treatment project. His stance has some analysts wondering whether the NDP can hold on to its progressive base in the years to come. Liberal candidate Paul Summerville, a well-known economist and political commentator, has focused his whole campaign on the sewage issue. He labelled the proposed sewage treatment project as the \u201cBillion Dollar Boondoggle.\u201d Even the Conservative candidate, who no one believes can win in Victoria, has put the issue at the forefront of his platform. The point is that these political actors, seeking to gauge public opinion and garner votes, don\u2019t act solely on their intrinsic beliefs. Political parties and candidates orient themselves based upon the political climate of their riding. This is where voters, those individuals who are not looking to make money or win votes, but who care about specific issues, must press their influence. This is the real nature and spirit of democracy. It doesn\u2019t begin and end with election night. \u00a0",

Imagine what the first argument about it might have looked like, millions of years ago. \r\rOg walks into a cave dragging some sort of saber-toothed whatever and catches Trog red-handed drawing a Neolithic hand turkey on the wall. Og asks Trog what it means, and from there the two launch into an intense, grunt-based debate over the meaning of art, which inevitably ends in one being beaten over the head with a blunt club. The argument over whether art can exist for art\u2019s sake is the kind of cyclical debate that occupied the minds of some of the greatest art buffs of all time, from Vasari to Gombrich. The question has been beaten like a dead horse because it\u2019s one worth beating; if we forcefully attach greater meaning to art, does it lose that which makes it timeless, turning it into ephemeral junk? However, if we have art without meaning, what separates it from kitschy cat-themed motel d\u00e9cor?This can go back and forth until faces turn blue, but on the local level at least, artists should be striving to tie their works into greater social themes in an effort to raise awareness or at least get people talking about certain issues. The reality is that not everyone can put a dead shark in a tank or paint a soup can and call it the greatest work of contemporary art this century. That kind of artistic pretense is reserved only for those good enough at systematically convincing others of their genius, something of an \u201cEmperor Without Clothes\u201d kind of principle. But in a community such as Centretown, the potential for artists to create tangible change amongst their neighbors is enormous. More importantly, this is the kind of place where if the message is strong enough, people might actually listen. Not to favour one cause over another, but the possibilities for change are limitless whether it be sparking chatter about mental health week and depression or challenging citizens to get up and support a charity of their choosing. It\u2019s not simply a matter of branding art with a hot poker and calling it this or that, but rather remembering that although art for the sake of art can exist in everyday life, it becomes truly powerful when it has the ability to leap out of its medium and touch something real. Artists should be coming to galleries armed with art that seeks a social change, that longs to delight and depose, something to wash away the dust of everyday life. In this way, art ceases to be a stagnant, incestuous, inaccessible institution and gets back to its original purpose; to pinpoint in society the things which we see as beautiful or ugly and expose them to the world.

Professional artists Lisa Thomas and Ginger McCoy volunteer regularly at the studio to help mentor artists. \u00a0\u201cThe studio has a really relaxed atmosphere, there is lots of humour, and it is a little bit like a family,\u201d Thomas says. Most of the art created for the display is landscapes, flowers, or animals. Some artists showed portraits, while others showed mostly decorative art created solely from memory. \u201cPeople who are not mainstream tend to be far more open-minded to the creative process,\u201d McCoy says. For the artists at Centre 507, some of the difficulties they face in their lives may be preventing them from achieving key life goals. \u00a0\u201cThese people often feel that they don\u2019t have anything they can share with the community and this is their chance to do that,\u201d Thomas says. Just as the art in the exhibit can benefit the community, the process of creating the art has benefitted the artists. McCoy says artists leave the studio with a sense of accomplishment and their heads held high.Rick Roy, one of the artists showcasing creations in the exhibit, says he has found the whole process of creating his art to be very satisfying. \u201cI\u2019ve never walked away from the studio where I didn\u2019t feel benefit from it, where I could say I wasn\u2019t better off.\u201d Roy says painting has always been one of his interests.\u00a0 He enjoys painting portraits, one of which was put on the exhibit\u2019s flyer. \u201cThey\u2019re very talented people, it\u2019s quite amazing what they have done,\u201d says Centre 507 and church board member Linda Pollock.\u00a0Roy says the planning for the exhibit was a co-operative effort. \u00a0The program received close to $5,000 to fund the project. Centre 507 received a $2,500 grant from the United Church of Canada and $2,000 from selling old pews from the chapel of the church. The rest of the money was raised through donations from the church\u2019s mission and outreach committee and the United Church women\u2019s group.The exhibit was also host to special guest speakers and performers such as former federal NDP leader Ed Broadbent, pianist William Blais and the Shout Sisters Choir. The gallery is open from Nov. 21-24 in the church\u2019s sanctuary room. Pollock says she hopes Centre 507 will acquire a permanent studio in the church and run more exhibits in the future. Without the group effort from Centre 507, the church, and the donations and grants, these artists would never have had a chance to succeed with their art, Thomas says. \u201cWe need to face the reality that there are people living on the streets right around us and going to drop-in centres trying to make lives for themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cThese things exist and need to be acknowledged so that people can find ways to support it.\u201d",

    "body": "The Whalesbone takeover of the Elmdale Tavern in Hintonburg has received flak from people who fear that the popular live music venue will lose the shows and charm.\r\rJoshua Bishop, owner of the Centretown-based Whalesbone Oyster House and new owner of the Elmdale, says he plans to maintain the Elmdale name and nature of the space, including live music. But he will be making a few changes and acknowledges there won\u2019t be as many shows scheduled in the future.\u201cWe want to maintain the Elmdale brand while expanding the offering to a full service with a kitchen,\u201d Bishop says. \u201cIt will be the Elmdale Oyster House and Tavern.\u201dThe Elmdale Tavern, first opened in 1934, is one of Ottawa\u2019s few live-music venues. Located in the working-class neighbourhood of Hintonburg, the tavern has been home to a slew of characters and generations of people longing for live music and entertainment. Bishop adds that he has been looking to acquire the Elmdale property for nearly a decade. \u201cI have been after the Elmdale since 2003,\u201d he says. \u201cI like the vibe of Hintonburg, I lived there from 2003 to 2005 and it\u2019s changed a lot since then, but it\u2019s still a great vibe.\u201d\u201cWe anticipate more patronage and feel that we will win over some of the niche crowd once they realize what we\u2019re up to,\u201d he says.Response to the purchase has not been overly positive. Some Elmdale patrons feel that the takeover will completely change the tavern. They took to social media to voice their concerns about the ramifications this will have on the venue, including fears that it will be torn down to make room for a condominium. Bishop\u2019s partner, Peter McCallum acknowledges the backlash. In an interview with the Ottawa Citizen, McCallum said that they were taken aback by the hostile reaction. \u201cI was crossing the street, wearing a Whalesbone T-shirt,\u201d McCallum said. \u201cAnd some guy yells at me from his car, \u2018Thanks for ruining Hintonburg!\u2019 \u201d Bishop, who aired his views recently in an Ottawa Citizen article and a CBC radio interview, says the reaction is a bit premature. \u201cPeople do not like change and will jump to create rumors and speculation at first opportunity,\u201d Bishop says. \u201cI think with the newspaper interview and the radio spot, it has calmed the masses.\u201dJack Lawson, a regular at the Elmdale Tavern, feels that the backlash is warranted but that ultimately, it won\u2019t do much.\u201cI think that people have a right to be angry, and have a right to criticize,\u201d Lawson says. \u201cAt the end of the day though, the new owners are going to do what they want with the property. Concerns should be voiced, loudly, but we won\u2019t know for sure how things are going to turn out until the deal is sealed.\u201d Like some Elmdale patrons, Lawson is worried about the change. He says that it will depend on how the new owners handle the transition. \u201cI\u2019d heard rumours that they were going to turn the Elmdale into more of a sit-down restaurant with a musical element,\u201d Lawson says. \u201cIf it goes in that direction, I feel like they\u2019ll definitely lose patronage. If the new owners keep the look and feel of the place, then I think it\u2019s way more likely that performers and patrons will keep coming back.\u201dHowever, some regulars at the tavern believe that this change will not be so bad. Mark Valcour, a regular freelance live show recorder at Elmdale, says the takeover will be a positive thing.\u201cThe folks running the Whalesbone will probably draw more people because they\u2019ll be more mainstream,\u201d Valcour says. \u201cWhereas the current owners of the Elmdale were more catering to the alternative side of the entertainment industry in Ottawa.\u201d Valcour adds that he will be affected by the change. With the proposed plans for fewer live shows at the Elmdale once the transition is complete, he says that he will definitely be at the tavern a lot less. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s going to mean I\u2019m not going to be there as much as I used to be,\u201d Valcour says. \u201cI think that\u2019s the end of its era as a tavern because the Whalesbone people are probably going to change the whole character of the place.\u201d ",

Rising costs of healthy food are a growing burden for Ottawa families, according to Ottawa Public Health.\r\rThe release estimates that a family of four will spend $745 per month to put healthy food on the table, a cost many low-income households struggle to afford. \u00a0The statistics come from the city\u2019s Nutritious Food Basket Survey that follows the basic costs of healthy living in Ottawa. The numbers paint a picture of a growing gap between nutritious food options and cheap processed alternatives.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUnfortunately, many families are not able to afford nutritious foods after paying rent and utilities,\u201d Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes, chair of the Board of Health, said in the\u00a0 release. \u201cThe cost of rent for a three-bedroom apartment has increased, and a fixed income leaves many families unable to consistently purchase healthy foods and cover other basic monthly expenses.\u201dThe high costs of eating healthy leaves low-income residents vulnerable to more of the health issues that come with a poor diet. \u00a0\u201cThe numbers are alarming because lack of food security can be linked to low birth weights, reduced learning and productivity, chronic disease and lack of nutrients,\u201d said Isra Levy, Ottawa\u2019s medical officer of health.\u201cHouseholds on fixed incomes and minimum wage earners have little left over to purchase sufficient amounts of nutritious foods.\u201d For Eric Lauer, a 20-year-old Carleton student and Centretown resident on a limited income, sticking to a healthy diet is a constant challenge. \u00a0\u201cNot only eating healthy but living a healthy lifestyle in general is a challenge when money is tight,\u201d Lauer said. \u201cYou have to make choices.\u201dLauer says he likes to stick to a mostly organic diet but the higher costs often have him thinking twice.\u201cIt definitely costs more to buy organic compared to stuffing your face at McDonald\u2019s for five bucks,\u201d he said.Low-income residents looking for healthier food options are not entirely on their own in Ottawa. \u00a0Peter Tilley, executive director of the Ottawa Food Bank, says the organization has gradually shifted to a focus on fresh and healthy food options to meet new demands.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a trend in the past 10 years where the Ottawa Food Bank has tried to get out more healthy food,\u201d says Tilley. \u00a0\u201cWhen I took over here, we were basically sending out the staples, but over time we began to focus on things like healthier cereals, whole wheat bread, fresh produce and our community harvest program.\u201d \u00a0Tilley acknowledges that the rising costs of healthy food in the past decade are very likely tied to a greater demand at the Ottawa Food Bank. \u00a0\u201cConsumers take a hit when the prices of chips and pop go up, but that doesn\u2019t affect us,\u201d he says. \u201cCertainly, when the price of healthy food goes up, we take a big hit in our budget.\u201dLevy suggests residents look to community-based projects that try to improve access to nutritious food.One of these projects, Ottawa Good Food Box, brings neighbours together to buy fresh produce at wholesale prices. That program runs all year round and is co-ordinated by the Centretown Community Health Centre.",

Centretown is on the list of targeted areas for the Sens Foundation and the City of Ottawa\u2019s joint project to introduce a series of outdoor rinks to neighbourhoods in need across the city. \r\rThe rinks will allow children and youth to \u201cbe active, participate in team sports, learn new skills, meet new friends, all of the good positive things that come with participation in social recreation,\u201d says Danielle Robinson, president of the Sens Foundation, the charitable arm of the Ottawa Senators NHL hockey club.The City of Ottawa and United Way have identified after-school time and weekends as \u201ccritical hours\u201d during which it\u2019s important for children to have access to these recreational opportunities, says Robinson.The new rinks will be equipped with an asphalt foundation, boards such as those found in arenas and will be comparable in size to indoor ice surfaces. Due to the smaller size of the project, the rinks will be natural surfaces rather than artificially cooled ones.\u201cIt should greatly increase the usability of these rinks for hockey and a whole variety of activities,\u201d says Dan Chenier, the city\u2019s manager of parks and recreation.The asphalt base will allow for multi-seasonal use \u2014 skating and hockey throughout the winter season and basketball and lacrosse in the summer.The plan is to build 19 NHL-size facilities in areas across Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec, says Robinson. The \u201cRink of Dreams\u201d built in front of city hall last year was the first of 20. That ice surface, however, has artificial cooling to allow it to be used on warm winter days, as well.Eight neighbourhoods have been identified as priorities for new rinks in the Ottawa area. \u201cThey tend to be economically disadvantaged communities that have been identified through the community development framework,\u201d says Chenier. Centretown, Bayshore, Overbrook, Heron Gate, Navan and Cumberland are all areas which have been identified.The selection of specific sites for the rinks is dependent on the suitability and donor preference, says Chenier. There are currently outdoor rinks in Centretown at city-owned recreation centres like McNabb and Jack Purcell. The Sens Foundation is funding the development project. It\u2019s working with the community by accepting individual donations, major gifts, and money raised through community partners such as businesses, citizen\u2019s groups or other potential benefactors. Money donated towards this year\u2019s rink project was raised through events such as 24h of Ski of Tremblant and Maharaja\u2019s Ball. \u201cThe faster we can raise the money to get these rinks done, the quicker that we\u2019ll build them,\u201d says Robinson.There will be $250,000 allotted to the construction of each rink, says Chenier, for a total project cost of approximately $2 million for the eight neighbourhoods. The project is also taking community opinion into consideration. As Robinson explains, it is \u201cmuch more grass roots in working with community organizations, schools, resident\u2019s groups within the actual communities that they\u2019re going to make sure that they\u2019re a success.\u201dJules Morin Park, on Cobourg St. at the corner of Clarence, in Lowertown, is the first rink to undergo renovations. Chenier says areas with existing rinks are more likely to be considered because project costs do not include the additional cost of bringing in water and lights. Lowertown residents were involved in the decision-making for the existing rink, says Chenier. Residents voiced their opinions on the location and the incorporation of facilities for lacrosse, which has a history in Lowertown. The asphalt court underneath the rink will be painted with various sports lines including lacrosse, four-square and hopscotch. For Norm Sharpe, chair of the Bytown District Hockey arm of the Ottawa District Minor Hockey Association, the creation of new outdoor rinks has the potential to address two of the major issues minor hockey associations face, availability of ice time and cost of renting indoor arenas. Though Sharpe says \u201cit\u2019ll only do that if the city takes steps to do things that will make this ice available to minor hockey.\u201dIf the ice can be reserved for practice, players can benefit from the experience of playing outdoors, says Sharpe. \u201cAs long as you structure your practice to use the facility properly you can have a lot of fun and it can even be seen as a team bonding thing.\u201d",

Women\u2019s hockey may not be as lucky.At the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge hinted that women\u2019s hockey may not have a future as an Olympic sport unless a more level playing field is established.Canada and the United States typically dominate competition \u2013 no other nation has won an Olympic gold medal in women\u2019s hockey \u2013 just as they did at this month\u2019s Four Nations Cup in Finland.In the round-robin portion of the tournament, the United States defeated Finland 15-1, and Canada defeated Sweden 9-0, before the two teams met in the final. Women\u2019s softball was scrapped as an Olympic sport for a lack of competitiveness, so any discussion about the same happening for women\u2019s hockey should not be taken lightly. Such a decision will only create a larger gap between North America and the rest of the world. \u00a0That\u2019s where the Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League comes in. Founded in 2007, the five-team CWHL could very well be women\u2019s hockey\u2019s saving grace. \u00a0The CWHL hasn\u2019t exactly inspired confidence thus far, but there\u2019s hope for a more prosperous future after the Toronto Maple Leafs and Calgary Flames announced partnerships with CWHL clubs the Toronto Furies and Alberta Honeybadgers earlier this month. The Leafs will invest $30,000 annually in the Furies organization for the next five years, while the Flames will invest $20,000 in the Honeybadgers for the next four. While $230,000 over the next five years may seem like pocket change to some, it\u2019s better than nothing. The CWHL needs any help it can get.\u00a0 Attendance is low, media coverage is rare, and the league isn\u2019t exactly swimming in money \u2013 its annual budget is about $700,000. Players don\u2019t even get paid. For the game to grow, such a league is needed to attract the best players from around the world. The only way players from other countries will improve is to have them train with and play against the best North American players.It\u2019s that simple.These partnerships could also pave the way for other NHL teams to get involved (it\u2019s not as if they have anything better to do at the moment). The Leafs and Flames have pledged to promote their now-affiliated women\u2019s teams via social media and other means. It\u2019s safe to assume most people hadn\u2019t even heard of the CWHL before these partnerships, so the increased exposure will only help.But there\u2019s still a long road ahead. The Canadian and American women\u2019s hockey teams will likely roll through competition at the 2013 IIHF Women\u2019s World Championship, which Ottawa is set to host in April. The same will probably be true at the next Olympic Games in 2014, but the IOC should remain patient. Women\u2019s hockey is still a relatively young sport. The first Olympic women\u2019s hockey tournament was held in 1998. Growth will take time \u2013 just as it did with men\u2019s hockey.Canada won the first four men\u2019s hockey Olympic tournaments. And in its first 16 years, only one nation other than Canada, the United States, or the Soviet Union captured gold \u2013 and even then, it was a Great Britain squad composed mostly of Canadian-trained players.Look how far the sport has come. Scrapping women\u2019s hockey now will only hinder any progress that\u2019s already been made, and prevent any progress that\u2019s still to come. ",

From peewee to the NHL, the image of a player lying on the ice after a knock to the head isn\u2019t a strange sight. \r\rBut Reebok-CCM Hockey and the University of Ottawa Neurotrauma Impact Science Lab have teamed up to develop safer hockey equipment to help make that sight a less common one. Awareness about concussions in professional hockey is on the rise, partly due to injuries sustained by high-profile players. But in youth hockey details about concussion are few and far between. Prof. Blaine Hoshizaki, director of Ottawa U's Neurotrauma Impact Science lab, says children especially are at risk of head trauma. \u201cKids . . . they either have a headache or they don\u2019t. In some cases it\u2019s hard to determine what happened because they all run into each other and fall down,\u201d says Hoshizaki. \u201cWho\u2019s hitting their head and who\u2019s not hitting their head? Some kids have pretty poor communication skills, especially young boys and it goes undiagnosed.\u201dThe Reebok-CCM Hockey and the University of Ottawa partnership uses the most effective testing for impact simulation specifically designed for hockey helmets. The partnership aims to make this type of testing the industry standard for equipment. According to a 2008 study published by the American College of Sports Medicine diagnosis of head injury usually only takes place if there is a noticeable change in the players\u2019 actions. But for younger players, diagnosis depends on the coaches or players\u2019 parent\u2019s medical knowledge which often means concussions are missed.Todd Jackson, risk and safety manager at Hockey Canada, says that the best way to prevent concussions in hockey is to improve all levels of the game. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to prevent concussions it\u2019s got to be an overall approach,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be skill development, it\u2019s got to be respect to the game and it\u2019s got to be good rules and good enforcement of those rules.\u201dBetter equipment is also essential. \u201cThe goal, of course, is to develop a technology that not only protects professionals, like the NHL, but also kids,\u201d says Hoshizaki. \u201cThere are a lot more kids playing the game and there are a lot more risks with children because they\u2019re not as skilled as the NHL players.\u201dThe development is based on testing the force of rotational impact \u2013 the impact that causes concussions \u2013 a helmet can take. Hockey Canada has developed an app that parents and coaches can use to recognize symptoms of concussion and tips on how to manage head injuries. Impakt Protective, an Ottawa-based company, has also developed a device for hockey helmets that lets coaches know via Bluetooth when a player has been hit with enough force to cause a concussion. Peter Smith, vice-president of Ottawa Centre Minor Hockey, says young players often miss out on playing brcause of head injuries suffered in other sports. \u201cWe more often have kids miss time because they\u2019ve had concussions in other sports like rugby and contact leagues,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWe recommend to all parents that they buy the latest technology from the helmet manufacturers.\u201d",

An exhibition about a man who saved an estimated 100,000 Jews during the Holocaust has come to the Canadian War Museum, marking the 100th anniversary of his birth.\r\rRaoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat based in Nazi-occupied Hungary during the Second World War, rescued huge numbers of Jews from being forcibly shipped to concentration camps. He used his influence and government connections to build safe houses, bring in food and medicine, and issue fake documents known as \u201cschutz-passes\u201d that gave the Jews diplomatic immunity from deportation. Many thousands of Jews avoided Nazi death camps because of his work.\u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful story,\u201d says museum historian Jeff Noakes. \u201cIt\u2019s about courage and strength and about helping others, even in the face of great danger.\u201dThe exhibition, \u201cTo me there\u2019s no other choice,\u201d was created by the Swedish Institute and the Living History Forum and features three sections made up of photos and text. Noakes says details from Wallenberg\u2019s childhood, his role as a diplomat in Hungary and finally his influence on the people he saved add a human story to the permanent Second World War displays at the LeBreton Flats museum.Wallenberg was detained by the Soviet forces in 1945 and disappeared into the notorious gulag prison system.The exhibition will also include a local story about Ottawa professor and philanthropist Erwin Koranyi. Before his death in June, Koranyi donated his schutz-pass to the Ottawa Jewish Archives. A photo of the pass, as well as a short biography, will be presented alongside the Wallenberg display.The exhibition started in Hungary, travelling to the United States, Russia, Israel, and Germany on its way to Ottawa. After its stop at the Canadian War Museum, it will finish its tour in Toronto.\u201cI think the exhibition is very touching,\u201d says tour manager Jenny Bergstr\u04e7m. \u201cWe\u2019ve met many people who have actually been saved by Raoul Wallenberg.\u201dBergstr\u04e7m says the exhibition has received an overwhelmingly positive response around the world. The goal isn\u2019t just to portray Wallenberg as a hero, she says, but to see how his actions affected people during and after the war.Rabbi Barry Schlesinger, of Agudath Israel synagogue on Coldrey Avenue, plans to attend the exhibition and says he will encourage his congregation to do the same. He says he hopes those who see it won\u2019t just look at it as an amazing story.\u201cHopefully it will inspire us to stop sitting on fences and be a part of something bigger than ourselves,\u201d he says.The exhibition is one of several events in Ottawa commemorating the centenary of Wallenberg\u2019s birth, including a tree-planting ceremony earlier this month at Raoul Wallenberg Park in Nepean. November is Holocaust Education Month.Holocaust survivor and Ottawa west end resident Vera Gara, 79, attended the tree-planting. She says it\u2019s important that members of the Ottawa community, both Jewish and non-Jewish, attend the exhibition.\u201cThey should know what happened. They should know who Raoul Wallenberg was,\u201d she says.Bergstr\u04e7m wants those who see the display in Ottawa to take away an important lesson from Wallenberg\u2019s story.\u201cThe message is we can learn from the past, that everyone has a responsibility to react,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the title of the exhibition.

    "body": "Brielle Morgan, Centretown NewsA new report outlines the many problems apartment dwellers face when it comes to garbage disposal. A consultation report presented at a city planning committee meeting earlier this month is calling for new guidelines for better waste disposal and collection in Ottawa\u2019s multi-unit residential developments. \r\rThe report was drafted after a review of collection and recycling practices in Ottawa apartments by engineering consultant company Dillon Consulting. It was then presented to city council Nov. 13.With Ottawa\u2019s population expected to grow by 300,000 in the next 30 years, the guidelines aim to ensure that developers, owners and property managers are aware of proper collection and storage systems and consider them when designing new apartments. The report outlined the many problems Ottawa apartment residents face when it comes to garbage disposal, including little collection space, a lack of access for collection vehicles and a subsequent increase in costs to the city. But perhaps the biggest problem is the apartments\u2019 garbage chutes, which allow for the mixed disposal of recyclables, solid and organic waste. The mixed collection contributes to the estimated 60 per cent of Ottawa waste that\u2019s sent to local landfills. \u00a0\u201cMost major urban centres experience issues with waste collection in multi-residential dwellings,\u201d explains Travis Woollings, sales and marketing manager at Orgapower Canada, the local company that processes the city\u2019s compost. Since 2009, the city\u2019s looked into investments for more efficient disposal and recycling systems for apartments, which have often been considered too expensive by officials and residents. \u201cSorting waste through a chute system is costly to have designed and installed,\u201d says Robert Dekker, vice-president of Centretown Citizens Community Association. But with a new bi-weekly garbage pickup system in place, the city must find a solution as issues such as waste storage becomes a bigger concern. With the report, the city may have found that solution: five systems for high-rise residences that would allow for disposal. Guidelines for low-rise apartments are also included, as the consultants called for the implementation of recycling, Green Bin programs and a maximum distance of 100 metres between stacked townhomes and outside storage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0All buildings and designs would have to meet applicable city bylaws, the committee says. \u00a0While the report outlines plausible solutions, some condo residents are still concerned.\u201cThese new buildings will have older residents who may not wish or be able to take green waste down for sorting on a once, or more than once a day basis,\u201d he says, echoing city councillors such as Coun. Mark Taylor. \u00a0\u201cHave you taken into account Ottawa\u2019s aging demographic . . . Have you looked at it through a lens of accessibility?\u201d Taylor asked at the meeting, adding the guidelines need to consider things such as those who would be throwing out the garbage.Despite these concerns, the report was approved by council. With Ottawa\u2019s multi-residential building collection contract expiring in 2014, the guidelines won\u2019t be applicable until then. \u00a0The initiatives could save the city roughly $8 million a year and avoid the overuse of its two landfills, which last year were reportedly running out of space.The planning committee said there\u2019s no financial implications associated with the report.\u00a0 ",

Acting on a planning committee recommendation, city council agreed to modify those conditions so that the dismantling could start almost immediately.The full site plan is not expected for another few months.\u201cIf we were to wait until the process is concluded, not only would we have subjected the building to another winter, but any process to refurbish or renew that heritage building could not continue until that site plan had been approved,\u201d said Coun. Peter Hume, chair of the planning committee.Hume added he believed that delaying the demolition would jeopardize the developer\u2019s $250-million expansion plan. The five-storey building will be demolished but parts of the facade on Rideau Street and Nicholas Street will be preserved. It will be stored until it can be incorporated into the new building.\u201cThe plan is to dismantle all the elements in the first three storeys and a portion of the facade,\u201d architect Barry Padolsky told the planning committee. City council approved dismantling the facade despite objections of members of Heritage Ottawa. David Jeanes, an urban activist, told the planning committee the dismantling of the facade would not be enough to save the building. \u201cWe are really only saving one third of the facade, we are not preserving it,\u201d he said.Hume said the decision to tear down the building had been made, so dismantling part of the facade was the only way to save it. \u00a0The Ogilvy Building, at 126 Rideau St., was built in 1907 as a department store and has been out of use for 20 years. The demolition is the first step of the Rideau Centre expansion expected to be completed in 2015. American retailer Nordstrom confirmed it will be a tenant in the mall.

LincolnDirected by Steven SpielbergStarring Daniel Day Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, John Hawkes, David Costabile, Lee Pace, Byron JenningsAfter the cloyingly saccharine War Horse and the flippant hollowness of Tintin, director Steven Spielberg returns to form with all the gravity this subject matter deserves, zeroing in on the quest of Lincoln and his associates \u2013 some of them, including James Spader\u2019s William N. Bilbo, comically nefarious \u2013 for enough assured votes to garner the two-thirds majority necessary to the success of a constitutional amendment.With support from his Republican compatriots unclear, opposition from the Southern Democrats overwhelmingly vocal, and a peace delegation making overtures on behalf of the Confederate States of America \u2013 with whom any treaty would destroy the possibility of abolition \u2013 Lincoln has a harrowing balancing act to perform even as he completes a significant philosophical maturation of his own.Daniel Day Lewis, with two Academy Awards under his belt, is put beyond the reach of praise by this performance. From fierce public oratory to faltering soliloquy, his Lincoln feels so effortlessly authentic \u2013 down to his vocal modulation and physical presence \u2013 it can only have come from an equally abundant measure of exhausting dedication.With an immense cast of talented actors \u2013 this is Spielberg, after all \u2013 the direction wisely minimizes gimmickry to focus on the characters and subtly underscore the action, and composer John Williams follows suit, stretching over 150 minutes roughly the same amount of bombast that accompanied Lincoln\u2019s 150-second theatrical trailer.Sally Field brings a delicate complexity to the role of Mary Todd Lincoln, and Tommy Lee Jones, playing Thaddeus Stevens, gets to indulge in the most cathartic, caustically verbose invective this side of the Bard.Joseph Gordon Levitt is the one actor who feels wasted on his role, but the A-lister\u2019s lack of prominence is hardly a concern amid this panoply, which includes Hal Holbrook (who won an Emmy playing Lincoln in a 1976 TV mini-series), David Strathairn (The Bourne Legacy), John Hawkes (Winter\u2019s Bone), Jackie Earle Haley (Watchmen), Lee Pace (TV\u2019s Pushing Daisies), Jared Harris (Benjamin Button), Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother, Where Art Thou), and many more.Watching Lincoln arrive at the idea of \u201cself-evident equality\u201d via Euclid is practically spine-tingling, and the realization dawns that this is the story of something indescribably momentous \u2013 a pivot in history. What\u2019s more, this is the history that matters most, a showcase of politics for the greatest possible common good instead of selfish, partisan posturing.But as much as Lincoln is a worthy portrait of the man and an engrossing glimpse into the past, the same film styled simply as the saga of the Thirteenth Amendment and shorn of its cursory closing bits \u2013 it passes up a perfectly good (and almost perfectly Spielbergian) ending in the house of Thaddeus Stevens \u2013 would play just as well without doing a disservice either to the great man who oversaw the events it recounts or to the great man portraying him with almost unnatural deftness.",

The most recent of the bank\u2019s Frontiers series of bill designs, the $20 note includes modern security technology and is the first of its kind to include large transparent windows.The \u201cIn the Money\u201d display at the bank-run museum displays the progression of Canada\u2019s currency from 1730 to the new notes produced today.Like entering a bank vault, visitors step into a room filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bank notes. Behind the steel barred door, the first part of the exhibit presents collectible bank notes in a chronologically organized drawer system. Caroline Roberts, the exhibition and program planner of the currency museum, says the permanent drawers are an enhancement to the exhibit. Visitors can pull out any drawer along the timeline\u2019s setup, and read about bank notes from previous years.In the last 77 years, six series of Canadian bank notes were released. Although the theme of Canadian heritage remains constant, the security features have been continuously updated. \u00a0The beet-red face of the original 1935 note series features the once-inventive technology of raised ink and fine-line patterns. A dozen or so drawers down the timeline you can see the Canadian Journey bank notes that you currently have stuffed in your wallet have come a long way. Providing a vivid pallet of colours, the $20 bill \u2013 the most recent of the series \u2013 includes a metallic strip, UV-light exposed text and ghost images that people enjoy looking for in the light.Stepping across the hall for the second half of the exhibit, visitors are welcomed by glass panels, touch-screen TVs and a large table lighting up the new $20 note. \u201cThe design of the see-through panels featuring the polymer notes was inspired by the transparent window in the new notes,\u201d says Roberts.Combining technology with hands-on learning, visitors may put their finger on the bank note via an interactive touch screen monitor.The monitors encourage visitors to spot the different security features, including fine print and hidden numbers. The new bill features engraved maple leaves and metallic images in its transparent windows.\u00a0\u201cThe windows are really cool.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to know they\u2019re hard to counterfeit,\u201d says Alon Valdman, a visitor at the exhibit.According to Julie Girard, the senior analyst for media relations at the Bank of Canada, \u201cthe incorporation of the metallic images in the transparency is what makes it state of the art . . . it is a difficult combination of security features to counterfeit.\u201dAlso shifting from cotton-paper to polymer plastic, the exhibit puts the lifespan of the note to the test. Visitors are asked to pull, fold and rub a $50 polymer note on display.\u00a0 More than 5,805 folds later, the obviously creased note is still intact.\u201cI really like how they will last longer.\u00a0 Like they can go in the washing machine and they don\u2019t get crumpled. That\u2019s cool,\u201d says Valdman.Girard says the new polymer notes will last up to seven years \u2013 that's 2.5 times longer than the previous series.Because the demand for bank notes rises in line with the Canada\u2019s GDP, Girard says the Bank of Canada must increase its production of bank notes to meet their growing demand.No details are given on the next series of notes, but the Bank of Canada is already researching the possibility of further innovation.\u201cThe Bank of Canada is always doing research to look at what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d says Girard. \u201cWhat that\u2019s going to look like I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t fill you in, but we are definitely already looking at it.\u201d",

    "body": "Environmental activists gathered recently outside the Canadian embassy in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, to protest the exploits of Canadian mining companies ahead of Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s official visit to the southeast Asian country.\r\rHarper should heed their calls by reining in the powerful mining interests that mess up the Filipino countryside and displace the people, in a process that helps maintain a steady supply of Filipino workers who serve Canadians via migrant worker programs rife with exploitation. It\u2019s a vicious cycle that starts with encroachment on indigenous lands by mining companies trying to extract precious resources. Ecological destruction caused by Canadian mining operations and extra-judicial killings of those who oppose these developments were documented by a delegation of human rights activists and clergy from the United Church of Canada when they visited the Philippines in January. Their report concludes that mines have polluted the Abra River with cyanide and mercury, bringing death and disease to the Filipino indigenous people, and the fish and animals on which they depend.It\u2019s a textbook process of colonialism: Large-scale resource extraction from abroad makes survival harder for indigenous people. Meanwhile, the Filipino state and feudal landowners, who claim ownership of huge swathes of the countryside, put pressure on the people to quit the land and make way for mining developments. Stripped of their indigenous means of subsistence, they\u2019re forced to compete for low-paying jobs in the cities. Political killings and forced disappearances of labour organizers help to hold down wages. The Philippines is the second most dangerous place in the world for union leaders, second only to Colombia, according to the Canadian Union of Public Employees. Constant, grinding poverty forces Filipinos to search for better wages abroad, leaving family behind. Overseas workers support their families and prop up the Filipino economy by sending home remittances.These brutal economic realities help explain why the vast majority of the so-called \u201cnannies\u201d who raise the children of well-off Canadians are Filipina. The live-in caregiver program (LCP) brings women to Canada from the Philippines, generally requiring them to work between 22 and 24 months before they are eligible to apply for permanent resident status. But many LCP workers say the process at Citizenship and Immigration Canada is plagued with delays, leaving them without the privileges granted to permanent residents, such as domestic tuition rates, even after their work quote has been fulfilled. In Ontario, the minimum wage for LCP workers is a measly $10.56 per hour, up to 48 hours per week.In practice, these women are often considered to be all-purpose maids, constantly \u201con call\u201d since they live with their bosses. The employer can also deduct up to $85.25 per week for room and board. \u00a0The services provided by these women are massively undervalued. They generally have professional training and experience in health services, and provide a high-level of care to children, the elderly and disabled in Canada. Yet some employers intimidate LCP workers by claiming falsely that they could be deported back to the Philippines if they don\u2019t cooperate. People from the Philippines and elsewhere who struggle in Canada with temporary or precarious status face similar threats from employers.It\u2019s a good thing there are groups such as the Philippine Migrant Society of Canada, which works to defend the rights of LCP workers. Ottawa has a PMSC chapter with over 100 members. Canada won\u2019t end its ongoing colonial history until we recognize how our corporations and citizens profit at the expense of these brave workers and their families.",

Espial didn\u2019t invent it, but it was able to capitalize on its humble beginnings.Espial president Jaison Dolvane started the company in 1997 as a software developer for Internet-ready appliances like digital televisions, mobile phones, set-top boxes (the small boxes that connect your television to a satellite or cable feed), and even automotive systems. Today, Espial develops software to be incorporated into smart TVs. These televisions allow viewers to share files and download video and other content from the Web. Espial also develops software, called \u201cmiddleware,\u201d that allows service providers to send IPTV signals into households.IPTV subscription is a service Ottawans won\u2019t be able to enjoy for at least a couple more years, says Mario Mota, formerly vice-president of broadcast and media research with Decima Research Inc., who now runs a consulting firm that provides market research for Canadian broadcasters. Ottawa\u2019s fibre optic networks need upgrades before a steady stream of video content could be \u201cpushed through\u201d to homes from service providers.To be able to deliver the capacity that TV requires, major changes to the infrastructure of these networks is needed. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply a voice line, or broadband Internet,\u201d says Mota. \u201cWhen you\u2019re delivering TV and offering video-on-demand, you need way more capacity.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge capital investment up front, with payback down the line\u201d in the form of decreased maintenance costs for the providers, says Mota. \u201cBut I\u2019ve yet to see that savings passed on to consumers.\u201dAs of March 2012, there are about 11.8 million households in Canada that subscribe to a television service. Of those subscriptions, 935,000 are IPTV. That accounts for an height per cent market share.\u201cIPTV is continuing to grow, and growing at a very healthy rate,\u201d says Mota. \u201cBell and Telus are growing and they\u2019re taking competitors customers away from the cable competitors in their markets.\u201dThough the Canadian IPTV market is a slow-growing one, the company sees hope in foreign markets.",

For merchants, it is a way to gain new customers and promote their business, while for consumers, it is a way to save money and try something new.The company also has a unique charity component. When Saving Ottawa sells one of their deals online, a portion of the revenue goes directly to the merchant. The company takes the other portion and donates some of it to a local Ottawa charity. Saving Ottawa currently donates to the Boys and Girls Club of Ottawa, the Ottawa Food Bank, the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation, the United Way, and the Ottawa Regional Cancer Foundation.Accounts and marketing manager Bruce Lamothe says it is up to the consumer to pick which charity they want their money to go to. The customer can either redeem their deal online (if it is an online deal), or print out a coupon that they can take to the store or restaurant.Lamothe says the business tries to rotate through the charities and organize a fundraising event tailored to each of them.\u201cIt\u2019s cool to have the tool there for the charity to make money off these sales,\u201d he says.When the Ottawa Regional Cancer Foundation asked Saving Ottawa to help out with \u2018Stache\u2019 for Cash, the company came up with the idea of having a deal for a traditional hot shave by a professional barber where all the money made would be donated to the cause. The hot shave deal is in partnership with Super Sam Barbershop located on Gladstone Avenue.Saving Ottawa also organized a competition called Ottawa\u2019s Best Mustache geared towards getting more people involved in the fundraiser. In order to enter the competition the contestant must post a picture of their mustache on the Saving Ottawa website. Through an online poll a winner will be chosen and awarded a cash prize of $1,000. Lamothe says the contest should encourage people to participate and be silly about their mustaches,\u201cIf it makes your girlfriend kind of angry that you have this big mustache, do it anyway cause then you can treat her to something if you win.\u201dErin Mcguire, events co-ordinator for the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, says the hot shave deal and mustache competition were a great fit with their campaign. She says the partnership allows Saving Ottawa to promote \u2018Stache for Cash through their contest and hot shave deal, and the ORFC is able to promote Saving Ottawa through the campaign, \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win situation,\u201dshe says.David Hicks is one of the contestants in Ottawa\u2019s Best Mustache.

The Centretown Citizens Community Association says it has few objections to the Iraqi embassy\u2019s request for rezoning to create a larger, more accessible building.\r\r\u201cWe found it to be an attractive design, particularly significant for the downtown area.\u00a0 And also we had no objections at all to the increase in height,\u201d says Robert Dekker, vice-president of the CCCA. The current McLeod Street building is a small, concrete structure across from the Canadian Museum of Nature. According to documents filed with the city, the Government of Iraq is proposing a larger, flashier building in its place \u2013 one that would resemble a ziggurat, a pyramid-like structure built in the ancient Mesopotamian valley of what are now Iran and Iraq. Though the proposal was received by the city on in September, it was not until the first week of November that the CCCA sent its comments to the city for review. Overall, Dekker says its concerns are few. He says its main concerns lie with the lack of setbacks from the sidewalks, which could cause a problem for both embassy security and lack of green space in front of the building. Dekker also says that parking needs to be looked into, because if the building were to take up some of the embassy\u2019s current parking lot, it could contribute more parked cars lining the street. For Ottawa\u2019s Iraqi community, the new building would be beneficial, says Mohammed Ghanim, president of Carleton University\u2019s Iraqi Students in Solidarity. \u00a0\u201cMost of us had parents who had to go through the embassy for most of our lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cThe embassy is really hard to access.\u201d Ghanim says the current structure has a very small, cramped waiting area, and currently it is not accessible for people with physical disabilities. He calls the space poorly laid out and says he believes the construction would be very positive for the Iraqi-Canadian community. \u201cThe Iraqi community, as it is, has a very negative opinion of the Iraqi embassy because of all of these things, in addition to actually dealing with the embassy itself. So at least it will be something positive to have this,\u201d Ghanim says. He says the only issue with the proposed building is that it could take up to five years to finish, which could cause even more problems with accessibility as visitors to the embassy navigate the worksite. The Canadian Museum of Nature is the largest non-residential building in the vicinity of embassy, and the plans suggest the new design will complement the museum\u2019s \u201cglass lantern\u201d at the building\u2019s main entrance. However, Dan Smythe, senior media relations officer for the museum, says CMN officials have no comment as they haven\u2019t examined the proposed embassy redevelopment in detail. \u00a0So far, the city has not approved the plan, but Dekker estimates a decision to be made by next month.

    "body": "Researchers behind a four-year scientific study have recommended the  establishment of two safe injection sites for Ottawa which they say  would help drug users and reduce drug use in the capital.\r\rDr. Ahmed Bayoumi and Dr. Carol Strike presented the findings of the Toronto and Ottawa Supervised Consumption Assessment on Thursday evening. The researchers participated in a panel discussion with representatives of the Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa and the Drug Users Advocacy League, as part of Ottawa AIDS Awareness Week. \u00a0\u201cA safe injection site is a legally sanctioned health facility where people can use illicit drugs under the supervision of nurses,\u201d said Strike. \u201cWe have not found them to increase drug use.\u201dStrike said establishing such a site would improve the health of Ottawa drug users, reduce public drug use, and save money for both the health care system and city maintenance. Bayoumi and Strike said there are more than 90 such sites internationally.Ottawa currently has the highest rate of new HIV infections among intravenous drug users in Ontario.The issue of safe injection sites has been controversial in Canada. Insite, the only legal supervised injection site in North America, opened in Downtown Eastside Vancouver in 2003. It has been credited with preventing 35 HIV infections each year, saving $8.7 million in health care costs. In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled to exempt Insite from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, a decision Bayoumi and Strike said sets a precedent for establishing a similar site in Ottawa. \u201cOver 50 per cent of people in Toronto and Ottawa support these sites,\u201d said Strike. \u201cThere\u2019s a core group in both cities who will never support safe injection sites, regardless of purpose for which it was designed or success.\u201dBayoumi and Strike recommend two safe injections sites for Ottawa and three for Toronto. They suggest multiple sites would dilute the potential negative effects on the neighbourhoods. They also recommend these sites be integrated with currently existing organizations which already have relationships with drug users. This would increase the anonymity of clients and cut costs. Insite, which is not an integrated facility, has an annual budget of $2.9 million, which would be greatly reduced without administration costs such as rent. Mandated programs, such as counseling, were found to be a deterrent to potential clients. \u201cA lot of people provided conditional support. They said they\u2019d support the facility if they had proof it worked,\u201d said Bayoumi. \u201cSo we recommend specified objectives, such as number of users and how often, and rates of HIV, Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B over time.\u201dHe said if the facility sets objectives, it can be easily evaluated to see if it works and what needs to be altered. At a community level, issues such as public litter, visible drug use and drug-related crimes around the site should also be evaluated. \u00a0Tarah Heighton, who works with the Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa, said she supports safe injection sites because they acknowledge the reality of addiction.\u201cThe ugly truth about addiction is that it exists because we as a society have failed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe greatest way we as a society have failed is that in times of extreme pain, those people who choose to do drugs \u2013 to turn to them as a way to feel better \u2013 instead of offering a hand to help, we tend to ignore and judge.\u201dHeighton, a former intravenous drug user who has been sober for one year, said the Ottawa community already has many services for drug users that have helped her, but it needs to do more.\u201cHarm reduction as a policy exists because it acknowledges that some people are not ready to change their ways and will continue to use drugs,\u201d she said. Police in Toronto and Ottawa vehemently object to a safe injection site, but support other harm reduction programs, such as needle exchanges and methadone clinics.Bayoumi and Strike said their report was not supported by the health minister or Premier Dalton McGuinty. \u201cI think the way forward is not through their endorsement, but from the community level up rather than from the decision makers down,\u201d said Bayoumi.A petition to support a safe injection site by the Campaign for Safer Consumption Sites in Ottawa has garnered 1,200 signatures as of Nov. 29.",

Lee Demarbre, one of the four co-owners of the Mayfair, told Centretown News early this month that, without a digital projector, the theatre would have to close by the end of the year. He says they had been worried about the change to digital for years.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long fundraising task that we put ahead of ourselves,\u201d says Demarbre. \u201cIt was almost a year raising money and to be honest, we didn't always think we could do it.\u201dThe Mayfair started raising money eight months ago with a series of fundraising screenings counting down the decades to the 80th anniversary. They also used Indiegogo.com, a crowd funding website, raising $22,355 from 188 online contributors.Demarbre says most of the money was raised from the screenings, but Indiegogo put them over the top. He says they are very grateful to their loyal patrons. \u201cIt\u2019s touching, I always felt the Mayfair was a bit of a movie church. You can go to the Silver City, the Empire Theatre, but the Mayfair is where you go to worship cinema,\u201d says Demarbre. \u201cSo we passed the collection plate around, and they feel it\u2019s important to help keep the movie cathedral open.\u201dDemarbre says he hopes to have the new projector by Christmas, but the Mayfair won\u2019t be showing digital films around the clock until February. His schedule for January is still mostly 35-mm films. He says the digital projector will allow a wider selection of films and the Mayfair will still occasionally show 35-mm versions. ",

    "body": "A group of Ottawa property developers is pushing back against proposed height restrictions for downtown building projects, setting the stage for a thorny debate over the Centretown Community Design Plan when it comes to city council.\r\rA consultancy group representing some of Ottawa\u2019s biggest builders recently issued a formal response to the plan that will determine, among other things, the scale of many Centretown property developments over the next generation. Ted Fobert of FoTenn Consultants Inc. says his company and its clients find the design plan as proposed to be quite well done, but also found issues in the secondary version of the plan, which he says is key to implementing the vision and which remains to be examined by city council.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t feel that the community design plan was at all well represented in the secondary plan that was done by the city,\u201d says Fobert.FoTenn represents companies such as Ashcroft Homes and Minto Group Inc. In response to the secondary plan, it submitted a 75-page review of the document as well as a 25-page revision of one of its key sections on urban development in the downtown area. The response displays FoTenn\u2019s ideas with strike-through in passages it didn\u2019t agree with and highlighted text to show its additions. FoTenn\u2019s version softened the language in some cases, for example changing \u201cprevent development which is incompatible\u201d to \u201cencourage development which is compatible.\u201d It also included a section of a list of properties that should be considered for increased height beyond the \u201cmaximum height considerations\u201d specified in the community design plan.The response specifically mentions 167 O\u2019Connor St., 330 Gilmour St., 315 McLeod St., 261 Somerset St. West, 359 Kent St., and 381 Kent St. as properties that would warrant reconsideration for height limits. FoTenn acknowledges that proposing increased height in certain areas might raise eyebrows, but defends the revision by explaining that it is well thought out. \u201cIt\u2019s not an automatic, you know, everything becomes high. It\u2019s that you have to demonstrate the appropriateness, you have to provide a community benefit that\u2019s an enduring community benefit, and it has to be judged to be appropriate,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a wide-open \u2018let\u2019s put high buildings everywhere in Centretown.\u2019\u201d Ottawa Urbanism is a group of citizens that promotes a city recognized for its design, architecture and liveability. Director Luke Schnurr says that when he read through FoTenn\u2019s revision, the height allowances were one of the things that stood out for him. He says that height tends to be the issue that creates sides in development, though Ottawa Urbanism feels it should be getting less attention. \u201cWe would advocate that height\u2019s not the most contentious issue, and that there are other issues which supersede its relevance and benefits to the citizens,\u201d Schnurr says. Leslie Maitland, president of Heritage Ottawa, says her organization is happy with the community design plan as it has been proposed to go to council in December without any further revisions. She says Heritage Ottawa likes the plan\u2019s design-driven approach over the idea of \u201cspot-zoning.\u201d Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, says the association had not begun its formal review of the FoTenn suggestions, but noted that from the little it has been discussed the group was \u201csurprised\u201d by the proposal\u2019s attempt to reopen the building-height issue.",

    "body": "A number of Norman and Beech streets residents in Little Italy are opposing a proposed 23-storey highrise development to be built on Norman Street.\r\rThe development is a \u201cblockbuster\u201d that sets a precedent for similar developments to pop up along Preston\u2019s smaller side streets, says David Seaborn, chair of the Dalhousie Community Association. The developer has made an application for official plan and zoning bylaw amendments to accommodate the planned residential tower.The properties, currently subject to a public comment period, are now designated as \u201cresidential low-profile\u201d under a neighbourhood planning document governing the Preston-Champagne area.At a recent informal meeting at resident Jamie Liew\u2019s home, community members cited concerns about traffic flow, sewer capability, building shadow and changes to the existing zoning set for four-storey development. Residents say meetings with city planners and developers are often during the workday and, as a result, there has been limited community representation with regards to the Norman Street proposal. The developer, the local construction firm Taggart Group, could not be reached for comment. The proposed development \u201creduces the carbon footprint by providing for compact, vertical living which has a smaller ecological impact,\u201d states the \u201cplanning rationale\u201d for the site. \u201cThe design of the four-storey, multiple-attached dwellings is sensitive to the low-rise built form along Norman Street,\u201d the document says.Liew\u2019s husband, Roman, says the building\u2019s shadow will affect his garden, and that he worries about flooding and damage to his house\u2019s foundation during construction. The condo on the dead-end street would overlook the O-Train tracks and have 159 units.The development is in its application stage and is getting mixed reviews from residents and businesses in the area. A variation of the application for the same property was turned down last fall.Recently, the application for the nearby Soho Champagne developments passed and will be built, and there is an application for a 32-storey building at the corner of Preston Street and Carling Avenue. Residents plan a letter-writing campaign to express their opposition to higher zoning.Intensification is a concern not just for people who live on Norman Street, but for residents of Little Italy who live on similar narrow, dead-end streets close to the O-Train, Seaborn says. The close proximity of the properties to transit makes applications for higher density more favourable to city planners, Seaborn says.Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes opposes the current plan for rezoning the site, according to an email circulated to residents. Based on the proposed Preston Carling Community Design plan, dense, high-rise development would be clustered around Carling but not in the interior section of the community that is currently made up of low-profile family dwellings, Holmes wrote in the email. Holmes also opposes a road suggested by developers to accommodate the extra traffic. The new road connecting other dead-end streets would replace a section of the multi-use pathway behind the O-Train. Liew says Holmes opposing the zoning amendment will not be enough to stop the building and that Holmes must make allies on city council.\u201cWe are not opposed to intensification, we are opposed to extreme intensification,\u201d Liew says. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Norman Street project poses a challenge for already limited parking in the area, and this problem is exacerbated in the winter months when snow banks build up, Liew says. She says she doesn\u2019t know how the street would accommodate up to 159 extra vehicles at peak hours.\u201cWe always knew when we bought the property that there would be development. But the area is zoned for four storeys, not 23,\u201d Liew says. ",

    "body": "David KawaiA small garden spruces up the sidewalk outside Luciano Foods at the corner of Somerset and Preston streets in Little Italy. During recent reconstruction of Somerset sidewalks and roads, landscapers added the garden.  Business owners and a leading community activist on the west side of Centretown are pointing to positive changes in the streetscape on the corner of Somerset and Preston streets as a boon for store owners and area residents alike. \r\rThe Somerset public advisory committee lobbied to have some of the area landscaped as part of the Somerset reconstruction project. \u201cYou got to jump on things when you see them, so if they\u2019re already digging up the road and they\u2019re already digging up the sidewalk, then you might be able to get them to do a little extra,\u201d says Eric Darwin, vice-president of the Dalhousie Community Association and a community activist for planning, transportation, streetscaping, and cycling issues in Ottawa. The little extra that Darwin is referring to is the added garden space that the advisory committee lobbied for. Before the addition, the small area, located in the parking lot of the Luciano\u2019s food market, looked rather drab with all of the concrete and plain, grey sidewalks surrounding it. Hidden behind a billboard and underneath a fire escape, it collected garbage and was generally an annoyance, according to Darwin.\u201cIt was just this dumb little spot that collects coffee cups and McDonald\u2019s wrappers, the sort of left over edge of a parking lot,\u201d Darwin says. \u201cIt was just a nuisance and it was paved because it was less work for everybody involved.\u201dDuring the recent municipal reconstruction of Somerset sidewalks and roads, Darwin and the advisory committee asked that the landscapers add a little bit of green to the otherwise dull spot. After adding a curb, some planters, some topsoil, and some hostas plants, there is now a small garden space in what used to be a nondescript patch of asphalt.\u201cIt has worked out better than we ever thought,\u201d Darwin says. \u201cThe plants are thriving, so there\u2019s a lot more light there than we thought coming in under the billboard and through the end. Nobody walks on it. It\u2019s just sitting there all by itself thriving and it\u2019s really nice when something like that happens.\u201dOther changes in the area are winning praise, too.A bland stretch of sidewalk has been replaced with red bricks, illuminated by stylish street lamps. The streetscaping of the Somerset and Preston sidewalks has improved the pedestrian environment so much that businesses say they are benefitting as a result of it. Elton Xhetani, a manager at the Luciano\u2019s food market, says it is a much more welcoming retail area today. \u201cIt made the street a lot prettier and yeah, we needed more green space,\u201d Xhetani says. \u201cWe have a lot of people around the area that come in when they\u2019re walking so it makes a difference when you have more people walking down the street.\u201dOthers agree that the streetscaping has made a big difference. Christine Ha, translating for her father because he did not speak much English, says that his Pho Bac Oriental Cuisine restaurant benefitted in more ways than one.\u201cBefore, we weren\u2019t considered part of Chinatown,\u201d Ha says. \u201cWhen they decided to do the streetscaping, we had to be included as part of Chinatown\u2019s BIA.\u201dAccording to the Ottawa Chinatown BIA website, the city approved the BIA boundary expansion from Rochester Street to Preston Street in 2008. The streetscaping, which added the distinctive Chinatown red streetlights and sidewalk, helped in changing the area\u2019s identity.\u201cIt definitely makes a difference in our business because now people are seeing that this is part of Chinatown now,\u201d Ha added. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more appealing. It definitely needed the facelift.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",

    "body": "Nestled in the heart of Hintonburg is a building that will soon be home to the Hintonburg Hub: a new location for Somerset West Community Health Centre\u2019s expanding services. \r\rThe centre announced a location for its long-planned satellite project Nov. 20. Scheduled to open in February 2014, the Hintonburg Hub will provide more than 1,100 residents with access to health services and join a network of community services already established in the area. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect place to be linked in a real hub,\u201d says Chantale LeClerc, Champlain Local Health Integration Network CEO. The building, located at 30 Rosemount Ave., neighbours the Ottawa Public Library\u2019s Rosemount branch, Ottawa West Community Support, Ottawa West Senior Citizen Support Services and the Salvation Army Bethany Hope Centre. \u201cWhen we heard this building was available, we jumped at the chance,\u201d Vicky Smallman, chair of the Somerset West health centre\u2019s board said in a press release. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge win for the community.\u201d Earlier this month, Yasir Naqvi, MPP Ottawa Centre, announced new funding that will allow the long anticipated expansion to become a reality. The Champlain LHIN will provide $334,000 annually to fund operations for the new centre. But these funds will not cover the centre\u2019s initial purchase of the land. Instead, the Somerset centre will leverage its existing building at 55 Eccles St. as equity, reducing the amount it needs from the government. Naqvi praised the Somerset centre for overcoming the hurdles of government funding and location. The centre\u2019s success is the end of a seven-year struggle to open a satellite location. The need for a new space was identified as early as 2007, but it\u2019s taken until now to make it a reality. Their latest setback came in October, when the Centretown Citizens Ottawa Corp., a non-profit housing organization, stepped away from the project due to other commitments and their director of development\u2019s resignation, leaving the hub without a home.\u201cAt the end of the day, the funding from the government was the least of their concern,\u201d says Naqvi. But even with a location secured, Naqvi says the centre still needs to raise an additional $500,000 to renovate the new building. The centre has plans to launch a capital campaign to raise the money, said Smallman in an email, advising those interested to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d To keep the centre cost-effective, Smallman said the Hub plans to use existing staff to run the new location, but did not explain how the centre plans to manage both locations in doing so. \u201cWe also hope to work with partner agencies on joint programming, which we currently do at locations all over our catchment area,\u201d said Smallman.\u00a0 Despite a surge in funding and interest in community health care in the past few months, some centres are still struggling to cope with the expanding downtown population. In Centretown, experts say that the population is growing rapidly with imminent construction of 4,000 new condo units creating an expected population surge of 20,000. \u201cWe need to pay attention to our growing population,\u201d says Simone Thibault, Centretown Community Health Centre\u2019s executive director, \u201cWe\u2019re in the same boat of trying to respond to the needs of our local community.\u201dFor CCHC, finding the place to expand isn\u2019t an easy option. But both Thibault and Naqvi say they\u2019re open to all possibilities, including partnering with condo developers or opening another satellite centre. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist,\u201d says Naqvi. For now, Thibault says she has submitted proposals to the Champlain Local Health Integration network and remains hopeful that new money will mean new services, and new ways to give Centretown residents the help they need.\u00a0 ",

Awarded to Cedar Springs Landscaping Group Ltd., a contracting company located in Ancaster, Ont., the contract outlines maintenance duties for the corridor, such as landscape and winter maintenance, waste management and the NCC\u2019s annual tulip program. According to NCC rules, with an estimated value of about $6 million, the contract had to be approved by its board members.\u00a0 Since 1996, Ottawa-based landscaping company, TerraPro Corp., has maintained and managed the corridor. After nearly two decades of their work, some board members questioned the decision to award the new contract to a company from outside the capital area.\u00a0 \u201cThe business is the same whether you\u2019re cutting grass and doing maintenance in Hamilton or Ottawa,\u201d said board member Jason Sordi at the meeting. \u201cThe issue is that they might not have those links to the business community here that they might have elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0 Sordi also questioned Cedar Springs\u2019 ability to do the work for the price to be paid, noting the significantly lower bidding amount posted by the company for the contract. On Sept. 4, the NCC posted a request for proposal for the contract on the electronic-tendering service website MERX. After several companies submitted bids, the NCC held a bidders\u2019 conference, conducted site visitations and held a question-and-answer period for the companies. Three companies, including TerraPro, were then considered and their bidding prices revealed.\u00a0 Cedar Springs submitted the lowest bid.\u00a0 There was a bidding difference of more than $2.4 million between themselves and the next company.\u201cWe want to be sure and have some level of comfort that the price discrepancy isn\u2019t also going to reflect some kind of difference in quality,\u201d Sordi added. \u201cI\u2019m just always weary when there\u2019s that much of a gap.\u201dBut according to Marc Corriveau, the NCC\u2019s director of urban lands and transportation, the gap is due to an annual financial adjustment of three per cent, equal to the consumer price index.\u00a0 Over a five-year period he explained, the CPI would create the approximate $2.4-million gap.\u00a0 Jack Wieske, president of Cedar Springs, says the discrepancy is no reflection of his company\u2019s performance. Adding that the company will be opening a new location in the city next year, he says he\u2019s confident Cedar Springs will be just as successful in Ottawa.\u201cWe have contracts all over the province,\u201d says Wieske. \u201cWe make connections with suppliers and other businesses wherever we go, we\u2019ve never had a problem. If I thought there was going to be an issue with dealing with suppliers, subcontractors or whatever else we needed, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten into this situation.\u201d\u00a0 Although maintenance of the corridor will be one of its biggest projects, Wieske and his company aren\u2019t new to the business; they\u2019ve worked in Belleville, Kingston and done projects for the Ontario Power Generation, (formerly known as Ontario Hydro). Wieske says the next step is to expand Cedar Springs.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a point where we\u2019ve been looking to start a second branch. Ottawa\u2019s always been a really desirable location for us,\u201d he explains.Despite the concern raised at the NCC\u2019s meeting, the board approved the contract. \u201cWe are comfortable with the fact that this is a new contractor,\u201d Corriveau said to board members. \u201cWe are confident with this contractor that he\u2019ll do the work.\u201dThe contract is set to begin next April 1.",

The Saint John, N.B., firefighter suffered severe head injuries when he fell five metres and died shortly after arriving at the Ottawa Hospital. Public Works Canada had rented the lift for window repair work at the Brouse-Slater Building on Sparks Street. After completing the work the lift was parked with its boom and bucket about five metres up in the air. However, the manufacturer of the lift, Genie Industries, says the boom should have been lowered to the ground when unattended.\u201cThe manual does require that the boom be stowed when it\u2019s not in use,\u201d says Rick Curtin, director of product safety at Genie Industries, adding that stowed means \u201cfully retracted, fully lowered.\u201d\u201cHowever, regardless of its position, the person should not have been climbing the boom,\u201d he says.By not complying with the operator\u2019s manual, the federal public works department may have been negligent, says Ottawa labour lawyer Paul Champ.\u201cLeaving the lift in an upright position is almost certainly negligence if the operational manual advises the owner and operator to keep it in a down position when it is not attended. I think that would be very strong evidence that the operator was negligent,\u201d Champ says. \u201cThis man\u2019s family probably has a strong action for negligence in this tragedy.\u201dContacted in Saint John, the family declined to comment.Ottawa police wouldn\u2019t say what exactly they investigated, including whether safety regulations had been ignored.\u201cWe look at everything, but we wouldn\u2019t disclose that,\u201d says police spokesman Const.

But look what happened. Someone was tempted to try to get to the bucket because it was up.\u201dAccording to Simplex Equipment Rental, the company from whom Public Works had rented the lift, it is common to leave unattended lifts up in the air to prevent people from stealing them by accessing the controls in the bucket.

I think that would be very strong evidence that the operator was negligent,\u201d Champ says. \u201cThis man\u2019s family probably has a strong action for negligence in this tragedy.\u201dContacted in Saint John, the family declined to comment.Ottawa police wouldn\u2019t say what exactly they investigated, including whether safety regulations had been ignored.\u201cWe look at everything, but we wouldn\u2019t disclose that,\u201d says police spokesman Const. Marc Soucy. Police wouldn't comment further.Cy Winter, a pro-life protester who holds a vigil on Bank Street near an abortion clinic five days a week just metres from the site of the accident, says he saw the parked lift unused in an upright position for at least a week before Clinton fell from it.\u201cIt was always up 15 to 20 feet,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI heard it was kept up so people couldn\u2019t climb into the bucket and use the controls. But look what happened. Someone was tempted to try to get to the bucket because it was up.\u201dAccording to Simplex Equipment Rental, the company from whom Public Works had rented the lift, it is common to leave unattended lifts up in the air to prevent people from stealing them by accessing the controls in the bucket. But the Ottawa branch manager, Yves Labb\u00e9, emphasizes that it was Public Works\u2019 decision to leave the bucket up.\u201cWe don\u2019t tell people what to do with the machines. Those guys, when they rent, already have their certification to operate the machine,\u201d he says.Public Works refused comment on why the boom was left up in the air, But in a written statement spokesperson Sebastien Bois wrote: \u201cWe are saddened by this unfortunate incident and our thoughts go to the family and friends of the deceased. (Public Works) is co-operating with the Ottawa Police . . . It would be inappropriate to comment further.\u201d\u00a0",

    "body": "Residents at the west end of Laurier Avenue are calling for better street design in response to parking headaches caused by the street\u2019s new segregated bike lanes.\r\rThe Bay-Bronson Action Group for Fair Access to the Road has sent a letter to Mayor Jim Watson and city council requesting the city address the need for parking on Laurier Avenue, specifically between Bronson Avenue and Bay Street. The group is backing up the request with its own detailed analysis of bike traffic on Laurier Avenue bike lanes. The analysis found cycling traffic has increased by just 16 per cent in the Bay-to-Bronson stretch since the city installed segregated bike lanes in 2011.Data for the analysis was collected from three bicycle counting stations installed by the city and verified by security cameras.Segregated bike lanes are physically separated from the rest of traffic by barriers such as concrete curbs, plastic poles, planters, and parked cars. The Laurier bike lanes are part of a two-year pilot project by the city and are the first of their kind in Ottawa.Richard Asselin, of the citizen action group and author of the analysis, says the segregated bike lanes have made it impossible for visitors to the area\u2019s condos to find parking within 100 metres of the buildings. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s extremely inconvenient and often costly when you\u2019re considering people like contractors and taxis who try to park near our buildings,\u201d Asselin says. \u201cSome contractors have refused to come to our building because they don\u2019t want to walk back and forth several hundred metres to their trucks.\u201d Asselin says the replacement parking lot for Laurier Avenue is about 350 metres from the buildings, a distance that is especially difficult for the large number of elderly residents in the area. Asselin says the problem is frustrating because the analysis shows there to be relatively little bike traffic at the west end of Laurier Avenue, especially in the winter months. The data show that between the middle of November and the middle of March, when temperatures are most often below freezing, bike traffic falls to a trickle on all parts of the avenue.Cyclists in the city have had a positive reaction to the segregated bike lanes, according to Hans Moor, president of Citizens for Safe Cycling. Moor says that more bike lanes are important for the future growth of downtown as more cyclists mean fewer large vehicles clogging up the streets. He says he is confident the city will eventually find a compromise for parking spaces.\u201cWe are convinced that the city will find a solution to satisfy the complaints of some condo owners near Bronson,\u201d he says. \u201cOne could think of a one-way street for example, or perhaps even a shared space.\u201dSome opposition to segregated bike lanes remains, however. The Bank Street Promenade BIA has released its own detailed report in response to the Laurier Avenue pilot project. The report cites parking, traffic, and Ottawa\u2019s long winters as reasons not to implement the segregated bike lanes.Asselin adds the action group does not want the segregated bike lanes removed but instead is seeking a compromise for access to the road. \u00a0\u201cMany people in our buildings like the bike lanes and make use of them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there is no doubt about it that there are a number of options that allow both bikes and parking in this stretch of the street.\u201dAsselin says he recently heard from city project manager Colin Simpson that the city is considering reinstating some parking at the west end of Laurier Avenue.Simpson was unavailable for comment.",

City council found about $5 million in the 2013 budget to cover this gap, $250,000 of which will now come from the daycare budget, leaving a shortfall of about $2 million. The daycare budget goes towards child-care programs and 15 municipal daycare centres across the city. There are almost 5,000 families in Ottawa benefitting from the subsidies. For the city\u2019s 2013 budget, staff recommended moving dollars from an area of the daycare budget that usually goes towards building repairs into a one year transition fund, which will help cover the social services gap.This transition fund is \u201cto address extreme hardship for any individual in need,\u201d Aaron Burry, the city\u2019s general manager of community and social services, wrote in an email.\u201cStaff did not think all the money in that account was going to be used this year, there weren\u2019t requests in for that money,\u201d says Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes. \u201cSo they felt those $250,000 that could be taken out of that capital account for one year, and put over in the operating account for special assistance for people.\u201dHolmes stresses the city would not take money out of the daycare services operating budget and that the changes won't affect families who depend on the services.All of this comes as the Ontario government pulls back on municipal funding for social services in efforts to reduce the province\u2019s $13-billion deficit. \u00a0Over the past few months, the province capped funds for discretionary benefits, such as dental care and prosthetics, for people on Ontario Works and the Ontario Disability Support Program. Queen\u2019s Park is cutting $7 billion from those types of services. The province is also eliminating the Community Start-up and Maintenance Benefit, a housing related support for people on ODSP, which will come into effect Jan. 1.Holmes says that when provinces cut municipal funding, even in tough economic times when it might seem necessary, this puts cities in a difficult position. They either have to cover the cost themselves, or make do without.It becomes even more difficult when cuts affect \u201cpeople who are the most vulnerable,\u201d she says. \u201cGovernments find themselves . . . trying to prevent a recession, because the world economy is not doing well,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cSo in order to solve that problem of having spent a lot of money on infrastructure, governments are cutting back and in this case cutting back on the backs of the poor.\u201d",

    "body": "The squabble between the Ottawa Public Library and the Ottawa Public Library Foundation seems to be a permanent one, with no chance for a resolution. The reason for the split stems from the foundation\u2019s inability to raise funds needed for whatever it is that OPL intends to do with the library building. \r\rRecently, the city and OPL decided to modernize the downtown library branch, instead of expanding or building a brand new library in a different location. A new library would be nice \u2013 the current one is drab, boring and inefficient in terms of space. It looks more like a remnant from a 1970\u2019s movie. So the foundation was set up in 2002 to raise\u00a0 funds for a new library. When the city realized\u00a0 that the foundation had not been raising much money, it decided to withdraw support. But instead of pointing the finger at the foundation for not being able to raise funds, OPL should take another look at itself and share some of the blame. There has never been a firm decision as to what the city would do with the downtown branch. Would it modernize the space to make it more reader-friendly, add\u00a0 two storeys, or would Ottawa get a brand new central library? These were the choices available to the city and the OPL board nut no firm decision was forthcoming. It is easy to imagine the difficulty the foundation had in raising money, then. Who wants to support a project they know nothing about? Imagine this scenario: You\u2019re walking down the street and a spokesperson for an organization that builds homes for underprivileged people in South America stops you for a minute. They ask for a donation to their organization, and you, wanting as much information as possible, ask what the money will be used for. The organization\u2019s spokesperson gives you a list of three different potential projects, which have not been decided upon. Would you give money to this organization, not knowing how exactly that money will be used, and without any specific details and decisions over the project? Would anyone? That\u2019s the issue that has been plaguing the foundation. Supposedly, it was raising money for a new library downtown, but a new building was just one option among many. That\u2019s what made it difficult to secure funding. Now that the city and OPL have finally decided to modernize, the foundation finally has a solid project upon which to focus its fundraising efforts, even if it\u2019s not the one it wanted. Giving the downtown library a facelift is absolutely necessary to attract more readers. Calling it quits now, when a decision has been made on what to do with the library, seems a bit premature. Instead, OPL should ask the foundation to intensify its efforts and concentrate on securing funding for modernizing the downtown building. There is no need for the foundation and OPL to part ways \u2013 they can still continue to work together to raise funds for the library. In fact, the goal should be easier to achieve now that everyone knows what will happen with the downtown branch.",

    "body": "Justice Minister Rob Nicholson\u2019s plans to amend the Criminal Code early next year to make it harder for mentally ill offenders to be released from custody will not make Canadians safer. \r\rRecent cases have brought to light the issue of how mentally ill offenders are punished, including the murder of 22-year-old Tim McLean, who was beheaded on a Greyhound bus in 2008 by Vince Li. Li was eventually declared \u201cnot criminally responsible\u201d for reasons of insanity. The fact that Li can now rejoin society under supervision on temporary passes angers the victim's mother, who publicly supports Nicholson\u2019s plans.\u201cI sympathize with the victims\u2019 family members and understand the psychological trauma they go through,\u201d says Chris Summerville, head of the Schizophrenia Society of Canada. \u201cBut I think the announcement is based on fear, not facts.\u201d Summerville is in regular contact with mentally ill offenders, some of whom were involved in high profile criminal cases. He says that the re-offending rate among these mentally ill offenders is around four per cent, and not a huge cause for concern.Offenders labelled not criminally responsible can face more lax treatment than those confined to prison.Nicholson\u2019s plans are in sync with the Tories\u2019 tough-on-crime agenda and purport to make public safety the \u201cparamount factor\u201d for review boards that decide whether an offender can be set free. Summerville says that the re-offending rate among those who are not mentally ill is around 47 per cent, compared with four per cent among the mentally ill. In other words, the fear that these offenders are being let go too early, thus endangering the public, is a myth and not supported by the evidence. The statistics show that the review system is working, but that the sprawling penal system designed to deal with sane criminals needs reform. Nicholson and the Tories have it backwards. \u201cRather than have a decision based in the way the system\u00a0actually operates and in existing Charter law, the minister is playing\u00a0to popular prejudice against this particular group of people,\u201d says Jennifer Chambers, a co-ordinator at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, a national mental health and wellness organization. \u00a0Both Summerville and Chambers note that lobbying by victims\u2019 family members and victim advocacy groups probably had an effect on the Tories, who are always keen to maintain a tough-on-crime reputation. Summerville and Chambers both say that the review boards already take public safety seriously and politicians don\u2019t need to get involved. Public safety is already paramount in the review boards\u2019 decision-making processes,they say.\u201cThe\u00a0reality is that people found not criminally responsible are almost\u00a0always held in custody considerably longer than if they were found\u00a0guilty and went to jail, and research shows that most are also less\u00a0likely to recidivate,\u201d Chambers says. \u00a0The proposed amendment is an attempt to consolidate the Tory image as the law-and-order party, unwilling to risk public safety simply because a psychiatrists such as Summerville bases his conclusions on evidence and science. \u201cThe Tories care about votes from the families members of victims,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cThey obviously don\u2019t care whether they have the support of mentally ill people.\u201dNicholson\u2019s announcement was made on Nov. 22 and did not give a detailed account of what the proposed legislation will look like, which makes it hard to pick apart the ways in which the amendment will affect existing legal structures. \u201cOne reason that this announcement is tough to comment on is because it\u2019s so vague,\u201d says Karen Monaghan, a media officer at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t all that much out there right now.\u201d However, Summerville, among others, has stressed that Nicholson\u2019s proposals may very well be subject to a constitutional challenge. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the leading 1999 decision Winko v. British Columbia that giving review boards the power to decide whether or not to release mentally ill offenders is not unconstitutional. This means that an amendment to the Criminal Code that attempts to upset the review board system is in itself a direct challenge to this legal ruling. This significant attempt to change the legal understanding of mentally ill offenders would hardly be possible if the Conservative Party didn\u2019t have a majority in the House of Commons.The pain of losing a family member or friend due to senseless acts of violence is not something to be taken lightly. Instead of carefully integrating the victims\u2019 families and relatives into the legal process in a nuanced way while being fair to those with mental illnesses, the Tories have once again shown themselves adept at reducing complex problems into wedge issues in order to consolidate power and win votes.\u00a0 ",

To make matters more difficult, the police have recently stepped up their presence in the ByWard Market on the rowdiest nights of the week in order to combat a perception that the population in the downtown destination was out of control. Matthew Skof, who heads the police union, says the answer is a new levy on alcohol sales in the market. But forcing revellers in one area to cover the cost will drive away business and unfairly punish Lowertown tipplers looking for a drink. Instead, high-traffic areas such as the market, Elgin Street, sections of Bank Street and Little Italy should have public surveillance cameras installed to monitor public behaviour and deter potential criminals.Surveillance cameras are already in use in private establishments such as gas stations, grocery stores and convenience stores. Extending the monitoring to the streets would be cost-effective. Used as a supplement, not a replacement for beat cops, cameras could catch perps in the act and provide a watchful eye on the excesses of the drunk near bars across the city. Using cameras would also free up officers to work on more serious crimes.The presence of police officers is obviously valuable to keeping the peace, but so too could cameras provide a deterrent effect for the petty crime that defines high-traffic areas. Having 24-hour high-definition video of some of Ottawa\u2019s most dangerous areas would be a boon to law enforcement, even if the feed wasn\u2019t monitored at all times. The cost and size of cameras has made them a commodity item, with startup and upkeep costs well below that of a uniformed officer.Public disclosure records from 2012 show more than 120 Ottawa police constables earned more than $100,000 in the past year. Their salaries are well-earned, but surveillance cameras never demand overtime and don\u2019t require benefits.Civil libertarians will decry the increased use of surveillance cameras for law enforcement as the first step down a slippery slope to an Orwellian nightmare of a police state. But cameras can act both as a force for law and a check on enforcement; cases of overenthusiastic police work would also be caught by the all-seeing digital eyes. A surveillance tape was key in the recent trial of an Ottawa police officer charged with sexual assault in relation to a jailhouse strip search. In this case, it\u2019s Big Brother who is watching the watchmen.There is no substitute for highly trained police officers walking the beat, but surveillance cameras in the ByWard Market, along the Elgin Street strip and down Bank Street could provide an invaluable aid to law enforcement and save the city money. Cameras in public spaces would not invade private life but rather provide a check on those who would do harm to others. The Ottawa police can use their limited budget more effectively if they invest in electronic surveillance.",

    "body": "Think powwow. Think music and dancing and drumming but leave the stereotypes behind. Think electronic beats and flashing lights and a throbbing bass underscoring it all. \r\rThis is the scene once a month at Babylon nightclub\u2019s Electric Pow Wow, featuring local group A Tribe Called Red and its musical creation, Pow Wow Step. \u201cAboriginal artists are continually surprising you and creating something else that you don\u2019t expect,\u201d says Allan Ryan, chair of the New Sun Conference for Aboriginal Arts. The Electric Pow Wow showcases both aboriginal talent and Native urban culture, according to ATCR\u2019s blog. Cle-Alls, a Skidegate Haida and member of the Task Force on Aboriginal Affairs at Carleton University, says aboriginal art is poorly represented in a place that\u2019s sitting on Algonquin First Nation land. He says both Aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities lose out when the art is absent.\u201cIt\u2019s very affirming for the Aboriginal people, it makes them feel welcome,\u201d he says of displaying aboriginal art. \u201cIt\u2019s also very educational for those who are not aboriginal, in a very positive way.\u201dArt can break down barriers between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people, says Ryan. And if the biggest realization is that Aboriginal people are more like you than not, well, it\u2019s a starting point. Music and dance play a huge role in aboriginal cultures, says Matilda Pierro, of the Odawa Native Friendship Centre. As a Wasa-Nabin program worker, Pierro teaches Aboriginal teenagers about the different aspects of their cultures. While she does not teach the monthly drumming program, she highlights its importance across different aboriginal cultures. It is a heartbeat that connects people, she says. First Nations, Metis and Inuit share this belief. Its origins are a mystery that most don\u2019t care to solve. Every culture had a drum, Cle-Alls says; the ones that didn\u2019t would use hollow logs or boxes. But every culture had a beat. That cultural beat is something some aboriginal youth are still struggling to find.\u201cI have many youth who have never known about their culture,\u201d Pierro says. \u201cThey know they\u2019re Aboriginal, but they don\u2019t know their background.\u201dThey grow up in the city, she says, with no ties to the reserves or aboriginal communities. And the mainstream media doesn\u2019t give them many people to look up to, says Ryan. \u201cThey don\u2019t see themselves reflected back in mainstream culture,\u201d he says. \u201cSo where are the role models?\u201d But traditional methods are only one way of learning a culture. Old ways can be combined with new trends.\u201cModern life changes and a lot of things have happened,\u201d Pierro says. Now aboriginal people can hear their music on the radio as well as at powwows, and the youth can connect to the new beats. The deep bass of electronic styles like dubstep \u2013 and ATCR\u2019s Pow Wow Step \u2013 can play a similar role to the drum, says Cle-Alls. It can be a beat for the next generation. Some don\u2019t like the idea of blending modern and traditional styles, says Ryan. But they are not the majority.\u201cThere\u2019s a way of taking from the mainstream and making it meaningful,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cIt is not diluting traditional culture.\u201dThe Haida people once navigated oceans using nothing but currents and paddles, says Cle-Alls. Then a boat showed up with sails. Suddenly, a lot of Haida boats also had sails on them. \u201cOur culture has grown with the environment around us, and that\u2019s not a bad thing if we hold true to the basic beliefs of our culture,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can add a sail here and there and cross the divide. A Tribe Called Red can use this new way to make a heartbeat.\u201d ",

But as we start the alchemy-like process of creating new music, let\u2019s not forget the roots behind the toots and what music can mean for the preservation and proliferation of culture, whether Canadian,\u00a0 Aboriginal or otherwise.We live in one of the most ethnically diverse nations in the world, with citizens hailing from a myriad of cultural backgrounds that can be traced back across the world. When immigrants move their families in search of a different life, one of the first things they bring with them are the songs and sounds of their country; these are bits of culture and history that can never be taken away or forcefully assimilated. Really, how many Canadians can say they haven\u2019t shed a tear during an incomprehensible Italian opera or laughed while failing miserably to keep up with a crescendoing Greek Zorba? Music has always been an instrumental medium through which people shared their culture with their children before showing it to the outside world. \u00a0It is for this reason that the CRTC long ago insisted on minimum Canadian content requirements for radio broadcasters across the country. What this means is that just over 30 per cent of any music a station plays has to be \u201cCanadian\u201d as defined by a list of requirements based on the brains behind any given tune. Despite often resulting in a bit too much Nickelback or Justin Bieber during morning commutes, it also ensures that music from within the country gets pushed to the front of the airwaves rather than getting lost in the static of musical influence from down South. Music has been used since the dawn of time as a means by which we shared stories with one another, huddling around a campfire, hitting a makeshift drum and yelling about a close call with a leopard or some other predator in a tree that morning. From the first person to tie a gazelle skin tight across a hollow log and give it a whack to innovative instrumentalists such as Stradivarius and Les Paul, every culture has chosen favourite instruments, rhythms and beats they call uniquely their own. Regardless of individual culture, music has retained the ability to strike a chord within the human emotional spectrum, whether it be fear, love or more along the lines of Beethoven\u2019s echoing Ode to Joy. Young musicians should be recognizing the writing on the wall and understanding that their hoots and toots come with baggage, whether they realize it or not. Music is the means by which we tell a tale, share a feeling, shake a leg or bust a groove, but it becomes alive when you play in a key that is uniquely your own.Whether it be folk, pop, blues, jazz or something with a much more international flare, learn your musical roots and play them with heart; if not, you might just lose track of them somewhere in the score.

    "body": "City of OttawaArtist Tim desClouds' installation will decorate the gate of McNabb Park at Bronson and Gladstone avenues.  Construction continues to plague much of Bronson Avenue, with the roadway still closed or half open as part of the city\u2019s major water and sewer upgrade, and an uninviting fence surrounds almost an entire block where the McNabb Community Centre and the adjacent schoolyard park are located.\r\rBut the Bronson Avenue that Tim desClouds hopes for is open and accessible, with a green space at the corner of Bronson and Gladstone avenues that engages in residents\u2019 everyday lives.DesClouds is one of two artists whose design was chosen to be showcased as public street art on Bronson once the dump trucks and backhoes disappear next year.DesClouds designed a piece of art to be worked into the area near the southwest corner of McNabb Park, where Bronson intersects with Gladstone. The all-steel piece is designed to serve as a gateway to the public space, with a maple tree branching out in the middle. The artwork is to include cut-outs of people sitting on top of the fence, and is conceived so that public benches can be built into the fence but appearing to fold out of the central gate.The project is being funded as part of the two-year-long Bronson Avenue Renewal project. The city is not only changing old sewer and water lines, but also repaving sidewalks and attempting to upgrade the streetscape as a whole for the community.Program co-ordinator Melissa Black said it\u2019s apparent from the outdoor art projects in other places around the city, such as along Bank and\u00a0 Preston streets, that the creative touches add a lot of value to public spaces.\u201cIt\u2019s colourful and it really enlivens the street,\u201d says Black. \u201cIt encourages pedestrians to walk up and down the street and discover all the different pieces, and I think that\u2019s really important for a neighbourhood \u2013 to encourage people to explore and wander around.\u201dDesClouds echoed the sentiment. \u201cIf you put something beautiful there then it might actually start the ball rolling to create a much more significant park for Bronson,\u201d desClouds says, adding that he hopes his artwork will help get the community to invest more in McNabb Park.The Bronson Avenue Renewal project will also include artwork designed by artist Andrew O\u2019Malley to be installed in front of the Bronson Centre near the northend of the street.O\u2019Malley\u2019s design is a light installation showing several figures representing the community, with the colour of the illumination changing from person to person to show the importance of individuals within the neighbourhood. Finally, all of the individuals synchronize as one colour, representing the community coming together as one.O\u2019Malley says this kind of art installation gives the community a sense of ownership and pride by giving people a high-profile symbol that also celebrates them.\u201cAdding a piece like Community Channel to the Bronson Centre announces the public and open nature of the centre to the public, and creates a local landmark,\u201d O\u2019Malley says about his winning design.According the city\u2019s website, the Bronson Avenue Renewal project will also lead to better cycling connections, the planting of more trees, and the placement of more street furniture along the revamped roadway.",

    "body": "Amanda Stephen, Centretown NewsThe basement of First Baptist Church may soon welcome homeless youth. The basement of a downtown church should be transformed soon into a small, temporary homeless shelter for youth after a city committee recently approved a zoning change to permit the charitable outreach initiative.\r\rOttawa\u2019s planning committee agreed to permit the First Baptist Church, at 140 Laurier Ave. W., to open overnight accommodation for homeless youth in the city, just in time for the coldest temperatures of the year. Restoring Hope Ministries, a small organization made up of three men, is planning to run the project in church\u2019s lower floor, providing food, beds and activities for six homeless youth from Friday at 9 p.m. to Saturday at 9 a.m. \u00a0Jason Pino, one of the directors of the initiative, says the church is in a strategic location, close to where all many young people hang out but, at the same time, far enough away that it gives the youth the opportunity to get away from places where unsavory activities can take place. \u201cWe thought it was the perfect location,\u201d Pino says. \u00a0The program aims to be the first of its kind in Ottawa, a temporary shelter that is fully financed and run by volunteers with donated items. \u201cIt\u2019s a great community initiative,\u201d says Pino. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it all ourselves, but together we can share what we have.\u201dSpots at the shelter will\u00a0 be allotted on a first-come, first-served basis, but Pino says those who can\u2019t be accommodated will at least be able to get out of the cold and get help from volunteers who can call around the city to find somewhere else to stay.Pino and his partners plan to begin by providing accommodation to male youth only, but they hope to include young women as their initiative grows. Initially, they say, it would be too complicated to provide accommodation for both female and male youth in the same, small space.The thought is that providing youth with somewhere to stay among members of their own age group will provide a sense of community and belonging. \u00a0Pino says he has a lot of experience with homeless youth in Ottawa. He and one of his partners, Michael Brum, have been leading community outreach projects together for years, and still hand out sandwiches and emergency items to the homeless, especially trying to help youth. Over the years, they noticed that a lot of young people living on the streets were being turned away from packed shelters and ended up sleeping outside, or in situations that could be dangerous. Says Pino: \u201cWe know that there are some spaces available that are designated for youth, but it just seemed that the need was greater than the amount of spaces that were available . . . After a while we had just had enough of seeing it so often.\u201d Pino says that\u2019s when he and Brum decided to pursue Restoring Hope, bringing in a friend, Clive Good, to help make it a reality. \u00a0The church\u2019s minister, Scott Kindred-Barnes, says there are still things to be addressed in the building to make sure the planned shelter space is up to code, but he noted that getting everything approved by the city was a major leap forward. \u201cHopefully, what will happen is that this will redress the problem of homeless youth in this city \u2014 that\u2019s the hope,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee of that, but let\u2019s hope.\u201d \u00a0Though the contract has yet to be signed, the church has worked with Pino\u2019s group throughout the process and is very supportive of the initiative, says Kindred-Barnes.\u201cA lot of people just want to do something and help,\u201d says Pino, \u201cand we\u2019re all sort of gathering our resources together and making it happen. It\u2019s awesome to be a part of.\u201d\u00a0 ",

As the holiday season approaches, volunteers at Centretown United Church are busy working to make this year\u2019s Christmas a little brighter for individuals and families in need within the community.\r\rFor more than 30 years, the Christmas Hamper Project organized by the church has supplied thousands of Ottawa\u2019s less fortunate with boxes of food, essential toiletries and small gifts to help them celebrate Christmas.This year, project organizers hope to reach 180 families and individuals who have been identified by partnering community agencies, including Centretown Emergency Food Centre, Centre 507, Dalhousie Food Cupboard, the Laundry Co-op, The Well, and Salus. \u201cThese projects are immensely important to the community,\u201d says Karen Lamberton, who co-ordinates much of the hamper program\u2019s administration. \u201cThe agencies are doing everything they can to feed and shelter their clients, but this project provides those extras at Christmas that the agencies just do not have the means to do.\u201dAt the core of the project is a small group of volunteers led by coordinator Susan McIntyre.\u00a0 They organize all of the additional volunteers and tackle the arduous task of collecting important details from identifying recipients and pairing them with \u201cadoptive\u201d groups and families, to packing and distributing the hampers at Christmas. This group starts working in September and contributes countless hours behind the scenes to make sure everything runs smoothly.Ann Hyland coordinates the packing of the hampers and has been involved with the project for 12 years. \u00a0\u201cI was out on a very cold night on Elgin Street, having been out to dinner.\u00a0 And in front of Elgin Street Public School there was a fairly oldish man sitting in the snowbank, begging,\u201d she says.\u00a0 \u201cIt was so cold, I really had to stifle an impulse to take him home, because I lived by myself at that time.\u00a0 I just felt awful walking away . . . it just haunted me.\u201dHyland says that after talking to a friend about the incident, he told her about the Christmas Hamper Program and she has been involved ever since. \u00a0\u201cPersonally, I think my motivation is through my faith,\u201d says Linda Pollock, who coordinates the distribution of the hampers. \u201cI believe that faith is something you really have to express through action. I\u2019m also a volunteer on the board at Centre 507, so I actually get a chance to work with and get to know people in need, and the hampers is another chance to help them.\u201d \u00a0Centre 507 is an adult drop-in centre that has been run in the church since 1983 and helps downtown Ottawa\u2019s disadvantaged residents.Pollock says she also finds reward in delivering the hampers to the recipients. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s generally a great experience,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you bring the boxes to the address, there is generally someone waiting there who is genuinely grateful and very happy to see you . . . sometimes very emotional.\u201dThe hamper project also draws hundreds of volunteers who contribute time and donations to create the baskets. Families and groups \u201cadopt\u201d a hamper, and collect all the goods and gifts needed by the hamper recipients.For many, the hamper program has become an important family holiday tradition and a way to give back to the community.\u201cPeople in the community, people in surrounding churches, everyone just wants to do something good at Christmas,\u201d says Hyland. \u201cPeople bring their children to choose gifts and to pack hampers for people less fortunate. The neatest thing is to see parents and children working together to do this.\u201d",

Apart from raising money for the library\u2019s programs and services, a major goal was funding a new main branch that was slated to become an architectural landmark for Ottawa and a showpiece\u00a0for the city\u2019s library system.McGill says the idea to dissolve originally came from the foundation itself after recognizing \u2013 soon after Mayor Jim Watson took office in December 2010 \u2013 that a new main branch was not going to happen in the near future.Watson said at the time that budget pressures, including the costs expected from city\u2019s planned light-rail transit project, as well as technological changes in society required Ottawa to rethink its planned $250-million expenditure on a new central library at the corner of Albert and Lyon streets.\u201cOver the last 10 years the priority assigned to the (main branch) project has moved down in the list of priorities in the City of Ottawa,\u201d says McGill \u201cAnd without that kind of focus for us and (a) flagship project, it becomes more difficult to raise money and more difficult to rationalize having a foundation.\u201dMcGill says the foundation recently told the library board that the fundraising body was considering dissolving. Then, unexpectedly, the library announced publicly that the foundation was dissolving. While the shutdown was not initially a certainty, McGill says the announcement makes it one.\u201cIt looks pretty inevitable now, particularly if one concludes that perhaps the library feels it does not need a foundation anymore,\u201d McGill says.The closing of the foundation comes at a critical time for libraries across the country. The library\u2019s main branch at the corner of Metcalfe and Laurier\u00a0 is undergoing a $6-million repair to ensure that it can stay operational.At a time when budgets are being tightened, France Bouthillier, an associate professor at the McGill School of Information Studies, says a foundation that focuses on fundraising should be the last place cutbacks should happen.\u201cFor me there\u2019s a contradiction,\u201d says Bouthillier. \u201cIf there is less money in the municipal budget for libraries, I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t push more on fundraising.\u201dHoward Whittaker, the former chair of the foundation board, says that the library could use the foundation now.\u201cIt strikes me as odd,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re moving towards a capital project; it strikes me as odd that they wouldn\u2019t see the value of a foundation.\u201dThe capital project he is referring to is the needed overhaul of the main branch. With the foundation closing, there is still money that has to be dealt with. Whittaker says he thinks the money, roughly $900,000, will go to a community foundation, which would hold the money for the library to access.Despite this, McGill is quick to point out that the foundation is still a strong supporter of the library.",

She says there's work in Ottawa for those trained in asbestos removal.Finding work nowadays can be challenging at best.\r\rFirst you have to find a job opening. Then you have to apply. Then there\u2019s the interview, and often a criminal background check.Finding work with a criminal record can be a nightmare, says one ex-convict who has been trying to find meaningful work in Ottawa. He wants to remain anonymous, out of respect for his wife and children and in the interest of finding employment.\u201cWhenever you go to an employer the stigma of having a criminal record immediately disqualifies you,\u201d he says. \u201cThey warned me while I was in prison that this was the easy part,\u201d he says, referring to completing the prison sentence. \u201cThe hard part is whenever you\u2019re back out on the street.\u201d \u00a0He says he has been able to get some work since completing a prison stint because he wasn\u2019t asked about his past during the job interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never lied about it and a lot of places don\u2019t have that in their questionnaires,\u201d he says.But he says eventually employers have discovered his past by searching his name on the Internet or through word of mouth. Sometimes this would happen months or even years of working at a job.\u201cI was told how good I was doing and that months down the road I could be considered for a supervisory job,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the very next day I was pulled into the office and I was let go, with no explanation. I was told months after that somebody knew of me and my past.\u201dHe says he even tried searching for work outside of Ottawa but eventually his past always ended up catching up with him.\u201cIn a stint of about two-and-a-half, maybe three months, I put out over 250 resumes, jobs I should instantly have, and I wasn\u2019t even getting called,\u201d he says. \u201cI know there are a lot of bad people out there, but there are a lot of people that have made mistakes and they\u2019re truly sorry for the mistakes they\u2019ve done.\u201dBut all that changed about a year ago when he discovered Rideau Social Enterprises, which is run by the John Howard Society of Ottawa, a non-profit that helps ex-convicts reform and find jobs.\u201cIf this program wasn\u2019t running, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d be doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI sent out an awful lot of resumes.\u201d Rideau Social Enterprises is funded by the City of Ottawa and Skills Development Canada. They offer two employment streams: bed bug extermination and an asbestos removal crew.\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of work available in Ottawa for people who are trained to do asbestos removal work,\u201d says Rhea Wootton, director of administration at the John Howard Society. \u201cWe send them off to Algonquin or St. Lawrence College in Cornwall to write the test, and they actually get their full-ticket certification through the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities,\u201d she says. \u201cWe act like a temp agency. We have about four asbestos companies and when they need labour they call us.\u201dFive Star Asbestos Removal, a company that does work in Centretown, is one of those businesses. It has a crew of about 10 permanent staff, but the company often hires workers from Rideau Social Enterprises to help on larger contractual work.\u201cThe problem with the asbestos removal business is there\u2019s a lot of ebbs and flows,\u201d says business manager Dave Kendall. \u201cOne week we\u2019re extremely busy, the next week we\u2019re not.\u201dBeing able to hire people who are already trained and certified to remove asbestos is helpful to companies such as Five Star. \u201cFor us to get a guy properly trained at what we do, it\u2019s going to be a process,\u201d Kendall says, adding that he hires through Rideau because the people he gets are trained. \u201cThey have the knowledge coming in,\u201d he says.But there\u2019s also a stigma involved with hiring workers with criminal records, says Kendall. Clients could be wary of having ex-convicts on the worksites or in their homes. For any contract that requires employees to have security clearance \u2013 such as government buildings \u2013 Kendall says it\u2019s impossible to use the workers from Rideau Social Enterprises. He says he mostly employs them in projects that involve buildings that will be demolished after the asbestos is removed.Kendall is quick to point out that the stigma is often exaggerated and the severity of past crimes not as heinous as many think. \u201cMost of them just can\u2019t get work or they just haven\u2019t been in that frame of mind,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople always think the worst of a lot of this, and it\u2019s really not the case.\u201dThe starting wage for employees in the asbestos program is between $13- and $15-an-hour, says Wootton. \u201cWe want our guys to have a livable wage. We want people to be able to get a good start and to be able to live.\u201d ",

    "body": "Poverty is impossible to ignore on the streets of downtown Ottawa and in other cities across Canada. \r\rThe poor and homeless we encounter on Rideau and Bank streets, many of whom struggle with mental illness and substance addiction, signal deep social problems that the federal government is now asking big business to address through \u201csocial finance.\u201d It\u2019s a fishy proposition and one that deserves scrutiny. Federal Human Resources Minister Diane Finley, speaking alongside Royal Bank of Canada CEO Gordon Nixon, announced at a Toronto conference recently that the government is seeking ideas from businesses interested in solving social problems \u201cby harnessing private sector best practices.\u201d Underfunded community groups and charities would receive much-needed cash from private businesses that stand to generate a solid financial return if the partnership can produce a better social return.The idea is that, given a sufficient profit motive, private companies would do a better job than inefficient governments in addressing social ills. It\u2019s mind-bogglingly ironic that big businesses would actually generate a profit this way after benefiting from low corporate tax rates linked to cuts in social spending that caused these social crises. But it\u2019s the growing trend across the Western world. In Canada, the Conservative government is taking a cue from countries such as the U.S., where the financial giant Goldman Sachs is lending about $10 million to an initiative aimed at keeping young inmates from reoffending after doing time at the Rikers Island prison. If the people running the education and counselling program for inmates in the New York City prison can meet certain targets for recidivism, then Goldman Sachs (a Wall Street icon known as the \u201cgreat vampire squid\u201d for its role in the subprime foreclosure crisis, which has seen millions evicted from their homes) stands to be repaid with more than $2 million in profits. Social finance is not a bold new idea, but a continuation of trends we\u2019ve seen for decades. While social spending shrinks, governments download their responsibilities onto charities and community groups that are forced to seek funding from private sector \u201cpartners.\u201d To be fair, some businesses clearly have social and environmental goals at heart when they support community groups and find clever ways to make such ventures profitable. For example, Five Star Asbestos Removal (featured above) does this by filling a labour shortage while employing ex-convicts involved with the John Howard Society, a prisoner reintegration group that ensures these workers get adequate training for a potentially hazardous occupation. \u00a0It\u2019s not glamorous, but it gives a second chance to folks who too often find themselves stuck in an endless loop between overcrowded jails and emergency shelters, without hope of employment. But such employment schemes are only necessary because we\u2019re living in a social system that\u2019s in disrepair, where decent jobs are scarce and people fall through the cracks. There are alternatives. Instead of profit-driven social financing schemes, big businesses and wealthy individuals should offer no-strings-attached funding to groups that push for programs of social change that include robust social services and employment. And the federal government should raise corporate taxes on big businesses such as RBC, which is raking in record profits while many among us struggle to make ends meet. This is a trend of increasing social inequality that numbs the human heart. Businesses should help face this crisis in the spirit of social solidarity. ",

With the click of a mouse, Ottawa residents can bring the farmers\u2019 market straight to their kitchen tables.\r\rFoodiePages.ca offers Canadians the chance to purchase specialty food products found at farmers\u2019 markets across Canada.Erin Maynes, 28-year-old former Ottawa resident and graduate of Lisgar Collegiate, was inspired to create the website after frequent visits to her local farmers\u2019 market enlightened her on the challenges small food producers face.\u201cIt seemed like there was an opportunity to help them expand their reach and awareness and get online selling to customers,\u201d says Maynes, who now lives in Toronto. Launched in August, with participation from 30 food producers in provinces across Canada, FoodiePages.ca has now grown to offer 73 Canadian producers\u2019 products.Though Maynes is based in Toronto, the website has expanded across the country. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want FoodiePages to be viewed as an Ontario or a Toronto market,\u201d says Maynes. \u201cIt was really important for me to build out producers from across the country.\u201dFoodiePages.ca lists small food businesses from British Columbia to New Brunswick. Currently, nine producers listed on the website are located in Ottawa.Carolina\u2019s Box of Goodness, an Ottawa business based in Lindenlea, was among the 30 original producers who started selling with FoodiePages.ca. It sells gourmet brownies.\u201cI do everything by myself. I\u2019m the one who cooks, I wrap, I sell, I do everything,\u201d says owner Carolina Foresti. \u201cI thought it was a good opportunity for me to have something act as my marketing agent.\u201dListing on the website has allowed her to reach new markets in Toronto and Vancouver. \u201cWithout (Erin Maynes) I wouldn\u2019t be selling to those places.\u201d Foresti started her business this June, selling 100 brownies a week. Now, sales are reaching over 300 brownies a week. Products sold on the website are shipped to customers through Canada Post.Apart from FoodiePages.ca, Foresti sells her goods at the Ottawa Farmers\u2019 Market and says she hopes to be selling in local stores by January. The opportunity to sell products at farmers\u2019 markets is time sensitive. Once the summer season ends, sales can drop by 50 per cent, says Maynes.With FoodiePages.ca, customers are able to access products\u00a0 online any time of the year.\u201cIt\u2019s like an online farmers\u2019 market really,\u201d says Maynes. \u201cAnd everyone has their own storefront where they can sell year round.\u201dThough there is no cost to list on FoodiePages.ca, producers must meet several criteria. Maynes looks for Canadian producers who are passionate about their products and are selling in limited regional distribution. Joanna Zappia, owner of Dolci, a gluten-free bakeshop based in Nepean, says her business\u2019 market has expanded since joining FoodiePages.ca.\u201cPeople are more aware of my business across Canada now,\u201d says Zappia.",

Gagne says the event will include a free outdoor concert featuring many different styles of music including award winning band Three Little Birds, Latino band Azucar Jam, local Ottawa band Autumn\u2019s Cannon, and a bigger name that has yet to be determined. In addition, Gagne says, people can also look forward to a vendor village selling coffee, hot chocolate and other grab-and-go foods, as well as a cash bar. There will also be a countdown clock and a ball drop at midnight to ring in the New Year. Merchants along Sparks Street have been asked to participate in the event by advertising or hosting their own New Year\u2019s Eve parties.

Everyone who \u201clikes\u201d the Sparks New Year\u2019s page on Facebook will have the chance to win a VIP package for the night valued at $2,000, Gagne says. Historically, Sparks Street has faced challenges including a lack of people living in the area. In the last 10 years, new condos have helped bring more people to the street.The Sparks Street Mall Authority is now coming up with more ideas to revitalize the street now that there is more of a population living downtown.\u201cWe really want people to see Sparks Street as a great place to get social,\u201d Gagne says. Future plans for Sparks Street include everything from new street signs and benches to completely resurfacing the area from Elgin Street to Bank Street and potentially painting it red, Gagne says. He says people can look forward to more events in the new year such as Canada\u2019s longest dining table, that will stretch the entire length of Sparks Street, from Elgin Street to Lyon Street.As a long-time merchant on Sparks Street, Layte says she has been a witness to the ebb and flow of the vitality of the once lively street over the years. \u201cTo be part of the transformation of Sparks Street to someone like me who is an Ottawa native has\u00a0 a real sense of accomplishment,\u201d she says.Somerset Coun.

The researchers participated in a panel discussion with representatives of the Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa and the Drug Users Advocacy League, as part of Ottawa AIDS Awareness Week. \u00a0\u201cA safe injection site is a legally sanctioned health facility where people can use illicit drugs under the supervision of nurses,\u201d said Strike. \u201cWe have not found them to increase drug use.\u201dStrike said establishing such a site would improve the health of Ottawa drug users, reduce public drug use, and save money for both the health care system and city maintenance. Bayoumi and Strike said there are more than 90 such sites internationally.Ottawa currently has the highest rate of new HIV infections among intravenous drug users in Ontario.Insite, the only legal supervised injection site in North America, opened in Vancouver in 2003. It has been credited with preventing 35 HIV infections each year, saving $8.7 million in health care costs. In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled to exempt Insite from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, a decision Bayoumi and Strike said sets a precedent for establishing a similar site in Ottawa. \u201cOver 50 per cent of people in Toronto and Ottawa support these sites,\u201d said Strike. \u201cThere\u2019s a core group in both cities who will never support safe injection sites, regardless of purpose for which it was designed or success.\u201dBayoumi and Strike recommend two safe injections sites for Ottawa and three for Toronto. They suggest multiple sites would dilute the potential negative effects on the neighbourhoods. They also recommend these sites be integrated with existing organizations which have relationships with drug users. Insite, which is not an integrated facility, has an annual budget of $2.9 million, which would be reduced without administration costs such as rent. \u201cA lot of people provided conditional support. They said they\u2019d support the facility if they had proof it worked,\u201d said Bayoumi. \u201cSo we recommend specified objectives, such as number of users and how often, and rates of HIV, Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B over time.\u201dHe said if the facility sets objectives, it can be easily evaluated to see if it works and what needs to be altered. At a community level, issues such as public litter, visible drug use and drug-related crimes around the site should also be evaluated. \u00a0Tarah Heighton, who works with the Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa, supports safe injection sites because they acknowledge the reality of addiction.\u201cThe ugly truth about addiction is that it exists because we as a society have failed,\u201d she said. Heighton, a former intravenous drug user who has been sober for one year, said the Ottawa community already has many services for drug users that have helped her, but it needs to do more.\u201cHarm reduction as a policy exists because it acknowledges that some people are not ready to change their ways and will continue to use drugs,\u201d she said. Police in Toronto and Ottawa object to a safe injection site, but support other harm reduction programs, such as needle exchanges.Bayoumi and Strike said their report was not supported by the health minister or Premier Dalton McGuinty. \u201cI think the way forward is not through their endorsement, but from the community level up rather than from the decision makers\u00a0 down,\u201d said Bayoumi.",

It showed that the price of some basic healthy foods had increased significantly over the last year.Jamie Hurst, a registered dietician at Ottawa Public Health, said the price of grapes, for example, has increased 35 per cent, tomatoes 78 per cent and ground beef 25 per cent in just one year. This raises concerns that there is a serious issue regarding food security in the city. \u201cWe are going to try to improve access to healthy food,\u201d says Hurst.To combat the problem, some organizations suggested new ways to provide healthy food for less money.Kaitrin Doll, who works for the local charity Ottawa Poverty and Hunger, explained the concept of the Good Food Market, which buys bulk food at wholesale prices for resale.The initiative started in 2011 in partnership with the Ottawa Good Food Box along with other local groups such as Just Food. \u201cGood Food Market are high- quality affordable fruits and vegetables, we are non-profit markets,\u201d she says. She explained that the Good Food Market brings healthy food directly to consumers and are a cheap alternative to farmers markets. \u201cFarmers' markets are not a viable option because they are not able to make enough money and so they are not necessarily the most affordable option,\u201d says Doll. \u201cThe unique part of the initiative is that we were able to bring not only fruits and vegetables to the community but also very needed protein.\u201dThis year, eight markets were held in four different locations in Ottawa including two in Centretown. Organizers hope to increase the number of markets and locations in 2013.The Ottawa Food Bank also outlined its plans to promote access to healthy food.\u201cThe number of people in need to access the Ottawa Food Bank has increased 2.2 per cent between 2011 and 2012,\u201d said Michael Howard, agency relation manager of the Ottawa Food Bank.Howard said as a result of the increase demand, the food bank is expanding its warehouse which will result in more space for offices, volunteers and storage. The expansion is expected to be completed by next January.The food bank is also providing more fresh food thanks to its community harvest program. The program is a provincial initiative that allows food banks to harvest their own crops for distribution. ",

A local floor hockey league for people with disabilities kicked off the 2012-13 season last month with its first two expansion teams. \r\rThe Gators and the Sharks, the league\u2019s first two official teams, met at Carleton University\u2019s Norm Fenn Gym, signalling the start of the Ottawa Power Wheelchair Hockey League season. Power wheelchair hockey is a relatively new sport in Ottawa, starting off in 2009 with just five players. Now, there are two official teams in the league, playing games every Sunday with 27 athletes. Recruitment is an on-going process. Wheelchair league players have competed in international and national tournaments in the past, as part of the tournament team the Ottawa Capitals. Players from these teams now make up the roster of the Gators and Sharks.Roddey Harb, recruitment director for the league, organizes demonstrations and recruitment days in community centres and high schools throughout Ottawa to show power wheelchair users what the sport is all about. \u201cWe provide an opportunity for people in wheelchairs to play power wheelchair hockey, which is basically floor hockey for people in electric wheelchairs,\u201d says Harb.Donna Haycock, the league\u2019s chairperson, says some of the talent on display is amazing, especially among youth playing for the first time.\u00a0\u201cThe smiles on these young faces playing the game they love makes everything worth it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s inspirational for these players to come out and show their sport.\u201dPower wheelchair hockey is played throughout Europe and North America, but the rules are different and neither European leagues nor North American leagues are willing to change at the moment. Harb says he has hopes that power wheelchair hockey will feature in the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\u201cThere\u2019s many different rules, it\u2019s almost like a different game over there,\u201d says Harb. \u201cBut it\u2019s the Paralympics . . . something\u2019s got to give.\u201dThe majority of power wheelchair hockey players have muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy, but anyone that uses power wheelchairs and has limited or no upper body strength or mobility can play. Players are ranked by the level of their disability, one to three: one being players that have upper body strength and mobility, two is players with limited upper body strength and three is players that have no upper body strength. These players have hockey sticks are attached to their wheelchairs.As in regular floor hockey, there are five players per side including the goaltender. There is, however, a ratio of the ranking of disabilities that can be playing at one time. On each team there can only be one player in rank one and two of each for the remaining ranks.Sydney Cameron, a veteran of power wheelchair hockey, says it can be frightening at first because of the number of wheelchair collisions but once spectators begin to watch the game they can see the skill level. Her son, Hollis Pierce\u00a0 \u2013 who plays for the Sharks \u2013 started playing power wheelchair hockey at a young age in Calgary before moving to Ottawa. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that people with such quiet bodies get to live out their athletic selves,\u201d says Cameron. Power wheelchair hockey is one of the lesser-known power wheelchair sports, according to Harb. Most people focus on power soccer or rugby, but popularity is on the rise, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get people out to try it,\u201d says Harb. \u201cBut once they try it, they love it.\u201d ",

It joins the Canadian Football League, the North American Soccer League and most likely Double-A baseball as pro leagues set to join the city\u2019s sports scene over the next two years. What\u2019s next? The National Basketball Association? The National Football League? Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League? While such rapid growth of the city\u2019s professional sports landscape will no doubt excite hardcore fans, it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where this all ends well.For any franchise to be successful, generating a steady revenue from ticket sales is a must. Putting wins on the board, creating a memorable fan experience and playing in a fancy new stadium will help, but at the end of the day it all comes down to the market.Is this market ready to support four new professional sports teams (in addition to the Ottawa Senators and the Ottawa 67\u2019s)? Maybe. But not within the span of two years. The CFL and NASL have long been expected to enter Ottawa\u2019s sports scene in 2014. Excitement has been building for years. Why would the ownership groups behind Ottawa\u2019s expansion NBL and Double-A baseball franchises risk competing with that? Everyone needs to take a deep breath. Whatever happened to baby steps?Among the four incoming teams, the CFL is probably in the best shape. Professional football has a long history in this city. Formed in 1876, the Ottawa Roughriders were a founding member of the CFL. They won nine Grey Cups. Things didn\u2019t end as well, of course, but at least they have an existing fan base to rekindle (not to mention a younger fan base that will likely emerge with varsity football returning at Carleton University next fall).With soccer making strides around the country, the NASL should be just fine in Ottawa, too. But adding two more teams may be pushing it. \u00a0The Ottawa-Gatineau region has a population of around 1.2 million, according to the 2011 census, so it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a shortage of potential consumers to target. But that in itself won\u2019t make this work. Look at the Greater Toronto Area, for example. That region has a population of around 5.5 million and yet teams such as the Toronto Raptors and Toronto Marlies still struggle to put \u201cbums in seats.\u201d This isn\u2019t to say Ottawa isn\u2019t an attractive market for expansion; but the timing just isn\u2019t right.As the population continues to grow and diversify, this market is only going to get better. The Conference Board of Canada came to the same conclusion in a recent report on the Canadian professional sports scene. It\u2019s a shame that concept seems to be lost on the ownership groups behind Ottawa\u2019s expansion NBL and Double-A baseball franchises. At least one of these organizations will suffer. It would be unrealistic to think otherwise. The only question that\u2019s left to answer is: Which one will it be?",

The team will tip off in the 2013-14 season.Ottawa\u2019s sports scene is booming. The basketball team is one of five new sports teams that will soon call Ottawa home. With the addition of the still-unnamed basketball club, the city will also welcome a professional soccer and a double-A professional baseball team as well as the return of CFL football to the redeveloped Lansdowne Park and the revival of Carleton Ravens football by 2014.While some fans may stress over which team to root for, Ian McCarthy, the NBL\u2019s chief operating officer, says the new sports organizations will complement each other rather than compete. \u201cEach sport has its own core of followers,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cIt\u2019s another night out on the town for fans.\u201dImpressed by the media coverage surrounding the new team, McCarthy says having a team in the capital is a big plus for the league. Highlighting what he calls a combination of great ownership and a superb venue, he sees the team as a good fit for Ottawa.After gaining huge public support and selling more than 11,000 season tickets, Ottawa became a self-proclaimed hockey town with the birth of the National Hockey League\u2019s Ottawa Senators in 1990.A native of Hull and current Ottawa resident, Takkale understands fans\u2019 principal loyalty to hockey.\u00a0 But he believes the city\u2019s basketball audience is growing, thanks mainly to successful varsity programs at Carleton University and the University of Ottawa.Winning eight of the last 10 national championships, Carleton\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team is the game\u2019s undisputed powerhouse in Canada. \u201cIn a place where people love basketball, in a place where university basketball is getting high attendance, wow, when pro ball comes to town it\u2019s going to be great,\u201d Takkale says.For the new franchise owner, Takkale saw the creation of NBL Canada as the opportunity to realize his passion for the sport.\u00a0\u201cTo own a sports franchise,\u201d he says, \u201cis a dream come true for me.\u201dThe team will be one of nine competing in the NBL. The league started in 2011 with teams in Saint John, Halifax, Quebec City, London, Moncton, N.B., Oshawa, Ont., and Summerside, P.E.I. An expansion team from Windsor joined the league for the 2012-13 season, the Quebec City franchise has since moved to Montreal, and Ottawa\u2019s scheduled debut next year will\u00a0 bring the league total to nine teams.Canada is no stranger to basketball. Dr. James Naismith \u2013 who was born and grew up in the Ottawa-area town of Almonte \u2013 invented the sport in 1891 while working as a gym teacher at Springfield College in Massachusetts, then a YMCA training school.Other notable developments in Canadian basketball history include hosting the National Basketball Association\u2019s first game \u2013 held in Toronto on Nov. 1, 1946 \u2013 and of the rise of B.C native Steve Nash as the NBA\u2019s most valuable player in back-to-back seasons in 2005 and 2006. In 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies, though the Vancouver club later relocated to Memphis.Takkale says the success strategy for the NBL\u2019s new Ottawa team is simple: cheap tickets and the 3 Es \u2013 energy, excitement and excellence. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to think about what the score is,\u201d says Takkale. \u201cI want them to leave with an entertaining experience for $15.\u201dFor Ottawa resident Jamaal Fannin, news of the basketball team came as a pleasant surprise. As a player in a recreational league at the Centretown YMCA, Fannin, a big fan of the sport, says there is definitely a large market for basketball in the city \u2013 but for the right price.Takkale is tasked with hiring a coach, recruiting a team and choosing a name. A name-the-team competition has already had a strong response, he says.\u201cWe\u2019ve had 276 names . . . I want to leave it for the fans to select the team name,\u201d says Takkale. \u201cIt is the Ottawa team and they can select it.\u201dOttawa residents can submit their name suggestions on the team\u2019s website at www.basketballottawa.com.

Centretown\u2019s rival curling clubs are gearing up for their annual grudge match to win a year\u2019s worth of bragging rights. \r\rThis year, the Rideau Curling Club will play host to the Ottawa Curling Club on Dec. 27, the latest clash in a competition that goes back generations. \u00a0\u201cThe Ottawa and Rideau are the two oldest, most competitive clubs and the two most decorated in the city,\u201d says Peter Murton, a spokesperson for the Rideau Curling Club. Allan Gilmour, a rich Ottawa lumber baron, founded the first Centretown curling club in 1851, the Ottawa Curling Club. The rivalry between the two clubs began in the late 19th century after Sir Sandford Fleming, a prominent member of the Ottawa Curling Club, left the club because it would not allow alcohol to be consumed after games. In his lifetime, Fleming had many successes, including the invention of standard time zones and the design of Canada\u2019s first postage stamp, the Threepenny Beaver. He was recognized worldwide for his successes and knighted by the Queen in 1897. Fleming is also the founder of the Rideau Curling Club. \u00a0The rivalry between the \u201cGilmourians\u201d and the \u201cFlemingists\u201d still exists. Jon Wall, a member of the Ottawa Curling Club, says \u201cthere is a bit of joking around and giving each other a hard time . . . but you still feel it, especially when you\u2019re on the ice because neither side wants to lose.\u201d Joe Pavia works in business development at the Ottawa Curling Club and is a curling blogger for the Ottawa Sun. He says the club will have 40 players, divided into five rinks in the challenge this year. The Rideau club will also send 40 curlers onto the ice to try to retain the challenge trophy. The host club always puts on a dinner before the match that is free for the visiting club.\u00a0 The challenge has become a social event where players can meet new members from their club and their rival club. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun because you get to play with members from the club that you don\u2019t usually play with or even against,\u201d Wall says. The winner of the challenge takes home a trophy that dates back to 1909. The plaque on the trophy reads \u201cTotal Games: 20, Ottawa: 10, Rideau: 9,\u00a01 tie.\u201d This so-called \u201clong-lost\u201d trophy was \u201cfound\u201d about 15 to 20 years ago and then put back into service at the challenge each year, Murton says. Pavia says the Rideau Curling Club has won most of the games in the last decade including last year\u2019s competition.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that most of the historic results haven\u2019t been preserved, but at the same time, maybe it\u2019s appropriate in that it keeps the focus on having fun with our fellow curlers,\u201d Murton says. \u00a0",

Andre Morson, co-director of the Compass Centre, says this is the first centre of its kind in Canada. The program is modeled on the North Star Centre for Self-Directed Learning in Massachusetts. Morson worked with North Star before deciding to work with Abby Karos, the centre's other co-director, to open a location in Canada. Morson describes the Compass Centre as an \u201calternative\u201d school, as opposed to a normal private school. The school allows students to create their own education scheme around their own abilities and interests. \u00a0The school does not have tests, assignments or grades, but this does not hurt the students\u2019 chances of getting into university. In the school, they are legally classified as homeschoolers and use the school\u2019s resources to learn what they want, when they want and how they want. \u201cIf we have tests and evaluations and assessments, that provides a competitive environment, and it changes the dynamic and the motivation of why they are going to learn and what they are going to learn,\u201d Morson says. Students who wish to enroll in the centre\u2019s first term in January will be getting a discount in tuition for participating in the pilot-program phase. Tuition will range from $1,250 for one day of instruction per week, or $3,500 for a four-day week. The centre offers workshops students can attend with an open-door policy, and students can request workshops, talks or even private tutoring sessions on subjects of their interest. Students can also choose to learn through internships or co-op placements. \u00a0Lauren Kniewasser, a 2012 Canterbury High School graduate specializing in the arts, says she is thankful that she went to a school that allowed her to pursue her love of art and says this created a better learning atmosphere. \u201cEveryone had a purpose and everyone was there for that purpose,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone was so much more willing to work. They just had more motivation in general . . . It\u2019s not the kind of high school that you dread going to, it\u2019s somewhere that you walk in and feel special.\u201dMorson says the distinction that the Compass Centre is not a conventional private school is important. It is a not-for-profit organization, he says, and is really there to serve the students. \u201cEven though we charge tuition, our advantage is that we won\u2019t turn away families that are unable to pay,\u201d says Morson. At Compass, clients can provide \u201calternative contributions\u201d that allow families to provide work or contributions at $25 per hour in exchange for the remainder of tuition they cannot afford. \u201cWe want to work with kids,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they\u2019re not happy in school we don\u2019t want them to be miserable. We want them to be happy.\u201dCorey Mayville, manager of the Bronson Centre, says that this is the sort of organization the building tries to bring in as tenants. The centre has a mandate to attract smaller, community-based organizations with limited resources. The centre has a long history of fostering education. The building was the home of Immaculata High School for 65 years until 1994, when the Catholic secondary institution packed up and moved to a new home on Echo Drive just southeast of Centretown.Besides the building\u2019s educational history, Morson says being in the Bronson Centre also makes strategic sense for what they do. Since students can opt to learn though internships with businesses and organizations, being in a building with other community-based organizations allows for links to be made for internships for the students. This is especially helpful for students whose parents are wary of allowing their child out in the city alone for the day. \u00a0Since students don\u2019t sign in and have the freedom to come and go as they please, parents are sometimes concerned about the lack of structure, says Morson, but he argues that young people should be given more credit in that regard. \u201cWhen you empower somebody with that ability, and there is that level of trust, then you\u2019re going to get remarkable things,\u201d Morson says, \u201cbecause you\u2019re not forcing them to do anything.\u201d ",

    "body": "Thirteen dwarves, a wizard and a hobbit set out on an adventure. \r\rThe punch line, in some quarters, is that director Peter Jackson and company \u2013 literally, in the case of Weta Workshop, which handles Middle Earth\u2019s special effects \u2013 are stretching the diminutive prequel to The Lord of the Rings into a complementary trilogy of three-hour epics.The Hobbit: An Unexpected JourneyDirected by Peter Jackson.Starring Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Sylvester McCoy, Andy Serkis, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee.ut there is plenty to smile about even for audiences who treat the world of Tolkien with something approaching solemnity and certainly for those little adventurers who aren\u2019t old enough to have seen the other trilogy.When Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) finds himself selected by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to participate in an adventure \u2013 wholly unknown except that, most un-hobbit-like, it will involve a great deal of travelling and the likelihood of danger \u2013 his life is upended by the arrival of a band of dwarves.Their names, which become a comic motif in the form of Gandalf\u2019s taking roll call, are Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Balin, Dwalin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori and Ori. For most intents and purposes, they coalesce into a single mass of hairy gruffness, but each has his quirks, and the characters are as well differentiated as any thinking viewer could expect among a band of protagonists fifteen strong.Their leader, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), is this series\u2019 answer to Aragorn: dark and earnest and seeking to reclaim a lost kingship, he is the very opposite of the good-natured Bilbo, who is as homely and timorous as he is unheroic and doubtful about committing to the dwarves\u2019 quest for a dragon\u2019s treasure.And while the dragon, Smaug, is an antagonist largely saved for later in the tale, the company has trolls, goblins, and a vendetta-driven orc chieftain to contend with en route, not to mention Gollum (Andy Serkis in another riveting motion-capture performance), who enters the story to trade high-stakes riddles with Bilbo and misplace a certain precious ring.A mel\u00e9e among stone giants which sees the adventurers trapped between brawling mountain crags is endowed \u2013 at least in high-frame-rate 3D \u2013 with a sense of real, physical mass and movement typically missing from this increasingly abundant sort of large-scale computer-generated spectacle.Dwarves careen and carom down the sides of mountains or through their cavernous innards, and all that\u2019s missing \u2013 except a closer resemblance to the fairly homogeneous dwarves of the LOTR trilogy \u2013 is a sense of genuine peril.But there is evil rising in the forest, as Gandalf learns in a meeting with Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and Elrond (Hugo Weaving) attended by Saruman (Christopher Lee), and this Necromancer \u2013 as discovered by the hermitic, animal-loving wizard Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) \u2013 presages the greater dangers to follow for Bilbo and all Middle Earth.Contravening the trend toward bigger, darker follow-ups, the welcome levity of Jackson\u2019s Hobbit offers the kind of true escapism never afforded by self-seriously \u201cgritty\u201d fare \u2013 and after Friday\u2019s events in Connecticut, most of the world could use a light-hearted escape.A few scenes are overlong \u2013 particularly the dwarves\u2019 dinner at Bilbo\u2019s hobbit-hole, which includes a dishwashing ditty like an old Disney reject \u2013 and others almost seem briefly to retread LOTR material beat for beat.But any time there is an eye-rolling moment or what seems like misstep, Peter Jackson quickly redeems it, reminding viewers that they are in the familiar hands of a storyteller completely at home in this world.Jackson shot The Hobbit at 48 frames per second, which allows for a much brighter 3D image than ever before \u2013 a particular benefit for the many scenes set at night and underground \u2013 and much crisper, smoother picture in general, but at the expense of the classic cinematic feel.Initially, the higher frame-rate is jarring, and the ultra-smooth, vaguely cheapened look it gives to small-scale movements has been called the \u201csoap-opera effect.\u201d But it pays off by making Middle Earth that much more immersive (though some may find it is \u201ctoo real\u201d or that the effect detracts from the traditional mystique of the movies) once its distinctive novelty wears off in the opening scenes.If An Unexpected Journey is not wholly satisfactory as a standalone adventure, it is because that is precisely what it is not. It very effectively introduces a group of characters whose quest to the Lonely Mountain, which they first glimpse at the end of this instalment, will carry them \u2013 and the fans in the audience \u2013 into the sequels, The Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again. Outright cliffhanger endings are pervasive enough in serial storytelling that this film\u2019s muted or incomplete arcs are less a surprise or a disappointment than a first taste with more to follow. Adaptations from Harry Potter to Twilight have received the split-movie treatment to flesh out characters more fully and expand on world-building, and if there is one universe of backstory that undeniably deserves the same it is Tolkien\u2019s extensive mythology of Middle Earth.\u00a0",

HoangIt's\u00a0my favorite time of year again!\u00a0Christmas is big in our house, really big,\u00a0like tacky neon Santa big!\r\rWhile preparing for this year's festivities I noticed a few additions that weren't there before,\u00a0babies and lots of them. I suppose it is only natural to start seeing babies popping up when you\u2019re in your 30s. Few things\u00a0bring life into perspective the way having a child can. Being called\u00a0daddy has\u00a0a way of changing the game of life and reminding you you're not just up to bat; you're\u00a0now\u00a0coaching the team. But coaching is much different than playing and not every good player can be a good coach.\u00a0The idea of becoming a parent is\u00a0overwhelming to me.\u00a0There's\u00a0no turning back, no refund policy and\u00a0definitely\u00a0no training manual with the little one's arrival. We do what we can to prepare and wait for the day we call ourselves parents; limited by the only experiences we have, trying to teach our kids the only things we know.\u00a0Various preparation strategies exist\u00a0for future parents\u00a0such as taking classes, gathering items, and reading\u00a0parenting books.\u00a0My wife and I also discovered a significant number of\u00a0people who\u00a0did little to prepare at all, no need to I guess, love is all you require they kept telling us . . . I'm scared of the lifelong marathon of parenting and what will undoubably test our\u00a0relationship, patience, intelligence, and finance.\u00a0Listen, unlike the new yoga pose you tried last weekend a good effort doesn't cut it in the parenting world. Our best efforts might be acceptable to us but may fall short of providing the necessary tools for our next generation to solve\u00a0their problems.\u00a0These lacks of personality traits have a ripple effect that leaves\u00a0formative gaps in\u00a0development throughout adulthood.\u00a0Kayla is her name and\u00a0she is our first child arriving just in time to be put under the Christmas tree. Everyone has been congratulating me,\u00a0like I had achieved something worthy of great praise. Truth is if you practice, try often, and focus really hard you too can probably have a child of your own. Congratulate me in thirty years when we can more accurately assess my parenting skills.\u00a0It all started during a vacation last year in Thailand where my wife and I discussed the idea of having kids. \"We're ready!\" she said with a convincing smirk. \"I'm scared,\" I replied. But I've always been scared before a big game, before an important exam, and this was no small decision. The world is a scary place and to succeed you'll need more than love, you'll need resources to get you the psychological filters necessary to cope with the endless challenges life throws at you.\u00a0With concerning statistics on self esteem and rocketing rates of depression, our young people are coping with more stressors than I can remember. Psychologist will tell you that there are two basic psychological needs for fulfillment, purpose and acceptance. How we define success is what changes over time and who we need acceptance from rounds off our sense of fulfillment.Holidays are a great time for us to stop, reflect, and assess if our current priorities are achieving the desired goals. To determine if where we have chosen to invest our time and energy are paying off the way we intended or will our children pay for the poor investments we made on their behalf?\u00a0As community officer focusing on crime prevention, my resolution for 2013 is to make more investments in our young people through the promotion of strong parenting strategies. By working with our community and service providers, I hope to help educate families to build capacity and address the challenges that hinder the potential of our future generation.\u00a0Best wishes this holiday season from our family.

The building will replace the existing two-storey commercial building, which houses European Glass and Paint.When the proposal was first reviewed in March 2012, city staff raised concern about the new building \u201ccompromising both the heritage character of the building and the heritage conversation district,\u201d according to the report. However, staff concluded that replacing the building is okay from a heritage standpoint. 488 Bank St. is currently home to European Glass and Paint, which has been in business since 1958 in this location. Allan Baker, who started at European Glass and Paint in 1966, said he is optimistic about the move to a new location on Woodward Ave. in mid-February. \u201cIt will be more efficient for us, since the new location is all one level,\u201d he says. Baker agreed that the proposed new building will enhance the beauty of Centretown. \u201cIt will improve this property and improve Centretown as a community, 100 per cent,\u201d he said.Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, said he has heard of the proposal, and has brought forward some suggestions to the city.

However, it is currently available at only three locations across Canada.The campaign\u2019s goal was 100 restaurants and $100,000, according Linda Eagan, President and CEO of the ORCF. The campaign surpassed the goal for participation, with 101 restaurants signing up, and many solicited donations beforehand in addition to the money they will raise through sales, according to Eagan.\u201cThe restaurant industry is supposed to be competitive, but through collaborations like this one, we are reminded how people just want to give back in the best way they know how. We are so grateful to restaurant owners and patrons for joining us in our fight for cancer survivorship,\u201d Eagan says.Eagan says she hopes that the event will become annual.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A full list of participating restaurants can be found online at:http://ottawacancer.akaraisin.com/dinearama",

City councillors will consider turning a section of Laurier Avenue West into a one-way street when they review the segregated bike lane pilot project in July. \r\rA one-way street between Bay Street and Bronson Avenue is one of several options being considered by the city, but is the one that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 senior project manager Colin Simpson says he is most excited about. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to implement, it\u2019s mostly signage and communication, and it would likely have the lowest cost impact and would probably provide the biggest gains,\u201d\u00a0 he says.The proposed change came out of a meeting Simpson had with representatives from the Bay Bronson Residents\u2019 Action Group for Fair Access to the Road in December.The group, representing many of the residents living in the six condominiums between Bay Street and Bronson Avenue, is protesting the loss of nearby street parking spaces.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the city will listen even more to what are the issues now that we\u2019ve lived it for two years,\u201d says Janine Hutt, president of the action group. The meeting resulted in four proposed changes to the lanes. One option is converting Laurier Avenue into an eastbound one-way street, another is taking advantage of the current construction on Bronson Avenue and extending the project to include raising the bike lanes to sidewalk level between Bay Street and Bronson Avenue. The city could also paint sharrows, or shared street markings, in place of the concrete barriers, or create a multi-use pathway connecting Bay and Albert Streets on Ottawa-Carleton District School Board property. \u00a0Hutt says she agrees that a one-way street may be the most practical option, but still has questions about safety and traffic. \u201cWe have no problem with that as an option,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the other hand, we would like to see what else is possible so that we can weigh them and be satisfied that all options were on the table.\u201d The four proposed options would only be temporary because in five years the city plans to implement its original plan to raise all the bike lanes to sidewalk level. The change is so drastic the city must wait until the entire street is being reconstructed. At the time the pilot project was first planned, Laurier Avenue was scheduled to undergo reconstruction in 2013, but budget constraints and other projects pushed the date back to 2018. Gary Watson, owner of Gary Watson\u2019s Cycling Courier, says he thinks all the proposed changes to the bike lanes are impractical. He says although he is one of the bike lanes most frequent riders, he thinks they should go. \u201cIt was a project that cost a lot of money and got quite a bit of people upset,\u201d Watson says. Such an opinion is a minority in the community, says Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association.\u201cThe people that we\u2019ve been talking to have enjoyed the use of the bike lanes . . . we knew that there were always issues with the bike lanes that had to be resolved, it\u2019s the reason why they call it a pilot project,\u201d he says, adding he's happy the city is resolving such issues.

    "body": "Erin Morawetz, Centretown NewsCentretown seniors are generally supportive of a report that recommends more support for home care. Ottawa seniors and community care providers have voiced support for a recent report for the Ontario government recommending more support for home care but some have reservations about a proposed new fee structure. \r\rThe report called \u201cLiving Longer, Living Well\u201d examines the current state of health care for Ontarians aged 65 and older. \u201cThe more home care you get, the better, because there are lots of people with mobility issues,\u201d says Alfredo Martinez, 58, who organizes a coffee club at the Good Companions Seniors\u2019 Centre on Albert Street. The recommendations include matching the elderly with primary health care providers, improving access to physiotherapy services, and expanding the capacity of long-term care homes.One suggestion, however, sparked mixed reaction: that seniors should pay for some home care through fees calculated based on an individual\u2019s income. In other words, seniors struggling financially would pay less. \u201cI agree to a certain point because it\u2019s based on your income,\u201d Jean Jonas, 87, a coffee group member, says. However, many seniors are already barely managing with what income they have, Martinez says. \u201cThere are so many people who cannot afford it. They are on a fixed income. You have to eat, too.\u201dThe payment recommendation could ignite serious debate, says Baudouin St-Cyr, chair of the Ottawa Community Support Coalition, which includes the Good Companions. This is because home care is currently paid for by community care access centres, which link the injured and sick to care providers outside of hospitals after they are discharged. \u201cWhen you\u2019re taking services out of hospitals that are free under the Canada Health Act and putting them into the home, that\u2019s going to be a big conversation,\u201d St-Cyr says. \u201cLook out, there are going to be some sparks.\u201dWhile Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Health has not yet adopted the recommendation, it is an important alternative to consider, says David Jensen, a ministry spokesperson. Ontario\u2019s growing and aging population is pushing health care costs to rise each year, which could bankrupt the province if it\u2019s not addressed, the report says.Another recommendation suggests Ontario should maintain its promise to increase funding for the home and community sector by four per cent for the next three years. \u201cWe\u2019re really happy with the recommendation of four per cent,\u201d St-Cyr says. He notes, however, that most of that money is going to acute home care rather than long-term, preventative programs offered through grassroots, volunteer-based community support service agencies. \u201cAcute care is really critical but so is the preventative care,\u201d he says. These services often cost a small fee. For example, Meals On Wheels delivers food to seniors for $5 a meal, St-Cyr says, who is also Meals On Wheels\u2019 executive director. Ontario currently spends about half of its $48.4-billion health-care budget on seniors.",

Wiseman says he expects it will be a hotly contested race, with more contenders expected to come forward.\u201cThere has been interest stated, but until anybody says that they\u2019re absolutely in, we\u2019re going to respect their privacy,\u201d says Wiseman.The riding is currently held by Liberal Yasir Naqvi, president of the Liberal Party of Ontario. Naqvi has held the seat since 2007 and says he intends to run in the next election, whenever that may be. He was re-elected in 2011 by a comfortable majority, one of the few Liberal MPPs who actually increased his share of the vote from the previous election.McKenzie announced her intent to run earlier this month and says she made the decision to enter now because of the \u201cuntenable situation\u201d with the province imposing a labour contract on teachers.\u201cThe teachers came out with a very reasonable opening position and I think the government\u2019s approach has been heavy-handed and has caused relations to just sour between the teachers and the government,\u201d says McKenzie.As the trustee for the Somerset-Kitchissippi area for the past six years, McKenzie says she has deep roots in the community and a passion for the issues affecting the people of Ottawa Centre.While education is a top priority for her, McKenzie says there\u2019s also a great deal of work to be done across the board provincially.\u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of mismanagement particularly in the education sector, but there have been other scandals, the power plants and the Ornge scandal, and I think this government has run its course,\u201d she says.Cullen, a former MPP for Ottawa West and Bay ward city councillor, says provincial politics is a natural step from municipal affairs and the anticipated spring election will be opportunity for him to bring his experience to Queen\u2019s Park.\u201cBeing on city council, and being a colleague of Diane Holmes, you\u2019re always dealing with issues affecting the heart of the city. I know the concerns that people have with respect to the quality of education, health care, social housing, and transit in particular,\u201d says Cullen.Since losing his seat at city council in 2010, Cullen has been working as an aide to Toronto New Democrat MP Mike Sullivan. He says he\u2019s been an active member of the party for more than 12 years. \u201cI think what I bring in terms of my knowledge of the issues, my knowledge of the community, my experience with the NDP and certainly at the municipal level gives me an advantage in terms of being the best candidate to win back the seat for the NDP,\u201d says Cullen.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a strong candidate who is on top of the issues, and who the public understands is a fighter for the community and these are qualities I bring to the table,\u201d says Cullen. \u00a0Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, and Kevin O\u2019Donnell, were nominated earlier by the Progressive Conservative and Green parties respectively.",

Sparks Street is at the heart of the nation\u2019s capital, just minutes away from Parliament Hill. Yet, much like other areas of the city itself, it quickly empties once work is done for the day. The boarded-up storefronts and construction crews certainly don\u2019t help to give it a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The zip line is like putting a Band-Aid on top of a gaping wound. So much more works needs to be done to change the image of Sparks Street in the minds of Ottawa residents before it can focus on gimmicks for tourists. The redevelopment plans for the downtown street are understandably murky; an outdoor pedestrian mall faces many uniquely Canadian problems, mainly the less-than-hospitable weather and suburbanization.\u00a0 But at this point it seems consensus is clear: anything is better than nothing. \u00a0Bringing life back to this outdoor pedestrian mall is a daunting task, but it is worth the investment. The question, however, is how Sparks Street can compete with the Byward Market just a stone\u2019s throw away?The Sparks Street BIA and its executive director Les Gagne seem to be up to the task of turning Sparks into a commercial centre. However, with the federal government owning most of the buildings, private enterprise only has so few opportunities to revitalize the area. \u00a0Despite this, the dull and drab street has come alive before, most recently with the New Year\u2019s Eve party that attracted thousands even in the cold weather. The BIA\u2019s idea to put in a farmer\u2019s market is a change in the right direction as well, even if it will only be open in the warmer months. The sense of community and connection that a market brings is what is missing from the street\u2019s cold stone walkways. But Sparks Street also needs to make a move towards year-round attractions. The rise in condo development downtown is a good excuse for more restaurants and pubs to move into the area, which will help to keep the street alive on evenings and weekends. Larger, high-traffic stores would attract people away from the Rideau Centre and make it worth people\u2019s time to visit Sparks Street, even on a cold, wintery day. Ottawa is a tourist attraction and this zip line will bring in some money and laughs, but don\u2019t forget about the people who will be walking underneath. Give Sparks Street back to Ottawa residents. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough.",

The Great Ice Storm of 1998 led to the largest deployment of Canadian military personnel since the Korean War. Communities depend on the troops to provide assistance quickly on a scale and with expertise no one can match.Yet the Conservative government made a secret decision last July to force local governments to foot the bill for emergency assistance. They never told municipalities or the public. It\u2019s part of the fiscal restraint announced in the last budget, cuts that the Conservatives claimed were to \u201cthe back office\u201d have turned out to be to essential services. They need to be reminded that there is only one taxpayer. The policy of billing a municipality that just suffered a disaster is fiscal foolishness. The Conservatives know the cost of everything and value of nothing.Amid a growing outcry, Defence Minister Peter MacKay issued a press release late at night claiming that there had been no change in policy, neglecting to mention that his Department will now be creating a bill and forwarding it to another department for collection. The effect is that the municipality or province will still be paying twice \u2013 once through their general taxes, and a second time to the federal government. While this policy may have already been on the books, previous governments recognized that charging disaster-stricken Canadians twice for the same service is unfair. These mixed messages must stop. Canadians take care of one another in times of emergency, no questions asked. The Conservative government must reverse this poorly thought-out policy immediately and give assurance to Canadians that it will not be stuck with a bill from their own army when the next disaster strikes.John McKay, MPLiberal Party Defence Critic\u00a0",

    "body": "Around 3:15 a.m. on New Year's Day, two men died in a crash east of Ottawa. \r\rA pickup truck collided head-on with a tractor-trailer on Highway 17. Neither man was wearing his seatbelt and both were pronounced dead at the scene. These are the first highway deaths in Eastern Ontario in 2013, following a high death toll in 2012.According to the Ontario Provincial Police, road crashes in Eastern Ontario killed 73 people last year, compared with 55 in 2011. In 16 of last year\u2019s deaths, the victims either failed to wear their seatbelts, or failed to wear them properly. In eight of those deaths people were thrown from their vehicles.It is difficult to say how many of these deaths could have been prevented if people wore their seatbelts, but it is fair to assume it would decrease the number of victims.So why, then, do some still choose not to buckle up?Algonquin College student Justin, not his real name, says he almost never wears his seatbelt. And it often doesn't occur to him to do so.\u201cWhen I\u2019m with friends, I rarely wear my seatbelt because we\u2019re always on the go and it just doesn\u2019t faze me when I get into the vehicle,\u201d he says, noting he only wears his seatbelt if he thinks the person he is with is a bad driver or he is riding with his parents.\u00a0\u201cI almost always wear a seatbelt when I\u2019m with my parents because they brought me up with it, and I would get in trouble if I didn\u2019t.\u201d Justin says he would be more likely to wear his seatbelt if he was ticketed for not wearing one. \u201cComing up to RIDE (Reduce Impaired Driving Everywhere) programs or talking to a cop, I put my seatbelt on. But if I\u2019m just driving past a cop, I just hide the seatbelt with my shoulder and they have never noticed.\u201d The cost of a seatbelt infraction is $240 and two demerit points, but Justin says larger fines would not convince him to wear his seatbelt.\u201cThe fine is pretty big already and would scare most people, even me if I got it, but you need those police officers there to give those fines and catch you,\u201d he says. \u201cMore police checking for seatbelts would make me wear it more often and get back into the habit of wearing one.\u201dMike Prud\u2019homme, manager of traffic safety and training for Canada Safety Council, says he is not sure what else can be done to persuade people to wear their seatbelts. Canada Safety Council is an NGO that does public awareness campaigns and publications focusing on a variety of safety issues.\u201cWe can\u2019t have a police officer in every car telling people to put their seatbelts on,\u201d he says.Prud\u2019homme says it is important for people to understand the seriousness of driving a vehicle.\u201cWhen driving, you\u2019re in charge of something that can potentially be very dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cDangerous to you, other people in cars, pedestrians, even wildlife.\u201dWhile it is impossible to have police everywhere checking to see that people are wearing their seatbelts, something needs to be done to decrease avoidable deaths on Ontario highways. A combination of awareness campaigns and more frequent checks could persuade people to buckle up before driving. It is common knowledge that seatbelts are mandatory, but people may not be aware of the consequences. Transport Canada reports that 93 per cent of Canadians wear their seatbelts and that seatbelts save 1,000 lives per year. However, the seven per cent of Canadians who do not wear their seatbelts account for 40 per cent of fatalities in vehicle collisions. Understanding these numbers is crucial and helps to demonstrate the incentive of wearing a seatbelt. Furthermore, Transport Canada reports that airbags are proven and effective safety devices, but they do not replace seatbelts. Front airbags will not prevent ejection from a vehicle. An aggressive campaign highlighting these facts could make people rethink seatbelt safety and consider the severe consequences of not wearing one. An understanding that there are circumstances outside of drivers\u2019 control while driving is necessary for safer roads. Someone may stop suddenly, be driving under the influence, or a deer could step onto the road \u2013 in any of these circumstances, it is possible that a driver may not have the chance to stop, let alone puton\u00a0 his or her seatbelt. Prud\u2019homme says that his best piece of advice for drivers is to be aware of what is around them. \u201cBe cautious and pay attention. Don\u2019t start daydreaming. People get familiar taking the same routes, so always be aware and look around.\u201dPrud\u2019homme also urges that people obey road laws, emphasizing that seatbelts save lives.\u201cWe keep educating and reiterating, people are aware of why they should wear seatbelts. They are for the protection of drivers and passengers.\u201d People who don\u2019t wear their seatbelts don\u2019t understand that while they may be excellent drivers, there is no guarantee that the people around them are. People can only control their own driving, so taking the necessary steps, such as wearing a seatbelt, to ensure safety in case of emergency could greatly reduce the death toll on Eastern Ontario highways. A safety campaign and more frequent seatbelt checks by police would help make wearing a seatbelt a habit for everyone. ",

That season, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa shattered the record books, both breaking Roger Maris\u2019 long-standing record of 61 home runs in a single season. McGwire finished with 70, Sosa with 66. It still ranks as the most exciting baseball season of my lifetime. \r\rNeither McGwire nor Sosa are in the Hall of Fame. Neither are Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, who appeared on the ballot for the first time this year. In a move by the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, the group tasked with inducting players each year, none of them were voted in because of their alleged use of performance enhancing drugs.The announcement on Jan. 9, that not a single player would be inducted this year brought back the biggest sports issue of the 2000s: steroids in baseball. And it begs the question: should steroid users be allowed into the Hall of Fame?The popular answer is no. But I say yes. Now, I\u2019m not so ignorant as to suggest that Bonds and Clemens did not use steroids. But we need to stop acting as if they were the only ones. For every Bonds, Clemens or Sosa, there\u2019s a Mike Lansing or Tim Laker \u2013 more obscure players who used steroids not to become superstars, but simply to forge out a Major League career long enough to make a living. Is Bonds more guilty than Lansing because he was a better player? Absolutely not. And it\u2019s been going on longer than anyone thinks.Baseball players have been using testosterone and amphetamines since long before the so-called Steroid Era. According to the Mitchell Report, the result of a 21-month investigation into the use of anabolic steroids in MLB, the government first determined steroids to be widespread in baseball as early as 1973. Former MLB pitcher Tom House admitted to using steroids his entire career, which lasted from 1971 to 1978. Pud Galvin is known as the first MLB player to admit to using steroids, which he did as early as 1889. Galvin is in the Hall of Fame. Perhaps voters should think about that the next time they cast their ballots. Yes, we should get steroids out of the game. But we should not penalize the guys who happened to play when the media decided they didn\u2019t like steroids. Eric Gagne, former Major League pitcher, wrote in his book that 80 to 85 per cent of players were using steroids during the 1990s and 2000s. So do we celebrate the small minority of players who didn\u2019t use performing enhancing drugs? Or, do we wonder why in the world those few didn\u2019t?Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens were the greatest hitter and greatest pitcher of their generation, respectively. For that, they need to go into the Hall of Fame. I\u2019m not advocating for steroids. They are illegal and to use them is cheating. But cheating has been going on in baseball since the game has been played. We need to move on, and make sure history doesn\u2019t repeat itself. But first we must celebrate that history. We can\u2019t erase an entire era. Let them in.",

Ottawans eager to lace up their skates and indulge in beaver tails don\u2019t have to wait much longer as the 35th edition of Winterlude is set to kick off on Feb. 1. \r\rAccording to Denise LeBlanc, a spokesperson for NCC, this year\u2019s winter celebration will feature a wide range of new events and sites to cater to the diverse cultures and interests.\u201cAs usual, we have the staples that people have come to know and love like skating on the freedom canal, the international ice carving competition, and the giant slides,\u201d LeBlanc says. \u201cBut, of course, we always have fresh programming and we always have new themes to keep things exciting and new.\u201dOne of the major changes this year is the addition of a new official site, the Marion Dewar Plaza, located at city hall. The official opening ceremonies will take place here, with skating shows at the Rink of Dreams, musical performances, and DJ shows happening every weekend for the three-week duration of Winterlude, LeBlanc says. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of Canada\u2019s diplomatic relations with South Korea. To celebrate this, LeBlanc says the NCC will display a Garden of Lanterns given to Winterlude by the South Korean Jinju Lantern Festival.The Garden of Lanterns will include 1,300 lanterns and will be 35 metres long \u2013 something LeBlanc says will be a rare sight. The ice carvings will also be lit up and on display along with public artwork.According to LeBlanc, Winterlude introduced a new business model two years ago to encourage more partners to become a part of the celebration. LeBlanc says this year, Winterlude has 75 programming partners \u2013 six times more than it had two years ago and the most they\u2019ve ever had. This means they\u2019ve been able to evolve their programming to extend beyond the usual outdoor activities and to include more cultural events like an interactive presentation about the Northwest Territories, photo exhibitions, and cooking demonstrations. LeBlanc says many of these events will be indoors so those worried about the cold can still come out and participate. According to the Winterlude website, the Glebe BIA signed on as a Winterlude partner for the first time this year. Throughout the duration of Winterlude, visitors can attend WinterFIT in the Glebe, which will promote healthy and actives lifestyles. WinterFIT will include a launch party with the Ottawa 67s, a snowboard competition, BBQ fundraiser and food drive, and workshops on skin and hair care and nutrition lectures. Roxy Doan is a Carleton University student and Glebe resident who says she is excited to participate in the Glebe Winterlude events. \u201cI\u2019ve never really gone to any Winterlude events except for skating down the canal, and I\u2019ve lived in Ottawa for two years,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a huge health nut though, so I\u2019ll definitely be attending those lectures about health and wellness.\u201d The Somerset-Chinatown BIA is also a partner this year and will present a Chinese Lion Dance on Feb. 16.Centretown residents interested in arts and culture can visit the Wellington West Warm-Up, which will include plays, gallery exhibitions, and artist profiles. For many people, including LeBlanc, Winterlude is a great time to celebrate the season of sweaters and scarves. \u201cWinterlude is really one of the reasons why I love winter so much. It\u2019s probably one of my favourite seasons,\u201d LeBlanc says. \u201cThere\u2019s always so much going on and it draws you out to enjoy the outdoors, get the rosy cheeks, and have a few snowflakes land on your tongue.\u201dBut as is the case every year, some residents have worried that Winterlude will have to be postponed because of a winter thaw. A recent warm spell raised questions as to whether the canal would open in time for the festival. \u00a0\u201cWhat if the canal can\u2019t open in time?\u201d asks Carleton student Olivia Parsons.LeBlanc says there\u2019s no need to worry. \u201cAs you can imagine, in 35 years of programming we\u2019ve had weather related situations . . . either the weather\u2019s too warm or the weather\u2019s too cold, so we always have a lot of contingency plans in place,\u201d LeBlanc says confidently.In fact, LeBlanc said the NCC and City of Gatineau make 30,000 cubic metres of snow every year to create the Snowflake Kingdom and to build the giant snow slides at Jacques-Cartier Park. Once the slides are created, she said they ice them so they last the entire three-week period. LeBlanc said they also have a special tent for the ice carvings to protect them from any sun or rain. Prep work has already begun for the celebration, including on the ground setup at venues around town, which will continue over the next two weeks, leading up to the event's official launch.",

    "body": "With a federal budget looming, there will be plenty of hand-wringing in the coming months as organizations that rely on government grants brace themselves for the worst. For artists and the institutions that support them, public money isn\u2019t their only source of income, but it often plays an invaluable role \u2013 not only at the federal level, but locally as well.\r\rSo it was undoubtedly with relief that the Great Canadian Theatre Company learned that\u00a0 Ottawa\u2019s community services committee decied that the city should offer up another $250,000 to help it pay off its building on Wellington West. In an economic and political climate where no funding is guaranteed, support from the city, even on a project that it has backed from the start, must alleviate some stress.But while the report that spurred the decision may have been a comfort to some, the sentiment isn\u2019t unanimous . Those with acutely tuned social consciences have pointed out that the money might serve the community better were it directed towards, say, housing the homeless \u2013 an argument that overlooks the fact that the funding for the GCTC is coming from a budget designated particularly for the arts.A more compelling point against the proposal is that the quarter-million-dollar contribution is equal to roughly half the city\u2019s annual funding for all such projects. To pump that amount into the company\u2019s Irving Greenberg Theatre Centre \u2013 on top of previous grants to help with the building\u2019s costs \u2013 will divert a significant chunk of public money away from other ventures. Still, anyone with a passing knowledge of the GCTC is aware of the kinds of programs it runs and it\u2019s difficult to say that it offers no social value beyond entertainment or art for art\u2019s sake. Focusing on productions with a specifically Canadian bent or origin, its programs maintain a commitment to promoting the craft within the country \u2013 a mandate that\u2019s increasingly important as the level of foreign cultural material consumed in Canada continues to creep higher. And the benefits of the GCTC extend beyond the obvious value it adds to the capital\u2019s (and, indeed, the country\u2019s) cultural landscape. The establishment of the new theatre at the corner of Wellington Street and Holland Avenue is at least one factor in the area\u2019s emergence as one of Ottawa\u2019s most desirable neighbourhoods. Retailers and residents alike are drawn to areas marked by cultural institutions, and Wellington West has certainly benefitted from the GCTC\u2019s presence.The new facilities have also allowed the theatre to increase its level of community engagement through events co-hosted with local outreach groups, part of a ripple effect often overlooked by those who criticize public funding for the arts. The advice on its way to city council is evidence not of a city hall beholden to the interests of a few, but one making good on its commitment to a vision it first endorsed nearly a decade ago.At this point, it makes little sense to cut the legs out from under an organization that has the potential to not only operate as a self-sustaining enterprise, but as an entity that will continue to enhance the vibrancy of the surrounding community for years to come.",

It was the debut of a three-year project called, Strengthening the Sector, which focuses on researching and developing resources for the visual, media and craft-based arts sectors in Ontario.Kristian Clarke, executive director of CARFAC Ontario, says the project is about creating and maintaining a new standard of best practices to guide professional relationships for everyone in the arts industry across Ontario. \u201cBest practices is really about ways of engaging with cities,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cIt\u2019s about ways that artists can know there are standard ways of doing business with institutions.\u201d For Clarke, these best practices, if put into place, will promote fluidity and reliability in partnerships by making sure galleries pay standard fees and artists act in a professional manner by meeting deadlines and attending openings. While these best practices can be instrumental in day-to-day interactions, Clarke says they also apply to larger-scale projects such as public art commissions. He offers the Lansdowne Park development as an example.\u201c(Had best practices been in place) some of the artists in Ottawa would have felt as though they were better consulted and better dealt with,\u201d he says.This project falls in line with CARFAC\u2019s mission, which is to guarantee that artists receive ethical and equitable profits for their work. Clarke, however, says this project is about meeting with the stakeholders within the arts sector to avoid thrusting an uninformed, one-size-fits-all standard on artists and businesses.That\u2019s why the first phase of the project is entitled Mapping the Province and consists of getting to know the current process, engaging with artists on the ground and mapping the cultural aspects of Ontario. Cities chosen to be a part of the initial consultation includes London, Ottawa, Thunder Bay, Toronto and Sudbury, all places Clarke says currently follow a handful of good practices. Clarke says these new practices will ideally replace an uneven system with province wide standards. He says galleries or city departments need to buy in to the project for the changes to happen.\u201cIf galleries start off and agree to them, they then say this is what we want as a basis for our relationship,\u201d Clarke says. So far, he says there is interest in Ottawa to commit to this project.Laura Margita, director of Gallery 101, says it\u2019s natural for the gallery, as a non-profit, artist-run centre, to participate in a project like this one. \u201cWe\u2019re a membership organization so we\u2019re always trying to get new members or find out who is doing art in Ottawa,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to be as tuned in and helpful as we can be.\u201dFor CARFAC, the next step is a follow-up survey to the forum held in Ottawa, which will lead to phases two and three of the project: Guiding the Province and Mobilizing the Province.

    "body": "Matthew Lee, Centretown NewsGallery 101 launches interactive video game exhibit by artists who grew up in war zones.  The sound of gunfire and shouting filled the room as bombs went off without warning. These sounds which would normally echo through a war zone could be heard from a local art gallery in Centretown last weekend, when Gallery 101 launched a new exhibit called Blown Up: Gaming and War. The free-of-charge exhibit features the videos and games of three artists from countries where war is a real thing, not a form of entertainment. \r\rThe curators at Gallery 101 are particularly interested in any kind of art that challenges norms and has an overt political or social message, according to director Laura Margita. Blown-Up features two interactive video games created by artists Mohammed Mohsen, who made an appearance at the opening, and Wafaa Bilal. The non-interactive video, Serious Games I: Watson is Down, by Harun Farocki, depicts a handful of new recruits in a virtual military training session. Meant to enforce realism, this implies that if they die in the game, they would have died in the field.Video games are not usually the first to come to mind when thinking of an art gallery. Typically, paintings or sculptures would come first, but Margita says she believes the lines between traditional visual art and media art are being blurred.\u00a0\u201cContemporarily, artists have an idea and then it can go in any direction,\u201d she says, \u201cThey just find ways to put it together. So there are a lot of media art or performance (art). I guess form has become more open, more accessible, wider.\u201dFor Saudi Arabian-raised Mohammed Mohsen\u2019s video game, Weak, the player-controlled character is neither a hero nor a villain, and in fact has no iconic identification at all. Mohsen sees video games as a way to examine universal issues, such as misrepresentation and the deconstruction of icons.\u201cI grew up in the \u201880s, in Saudi Arabia. I grew up under dictatorship,\u201d Mohsen says. \u201cOne of the things that weren\u2019t effectively censored was videogames. It was, in a way for me, a space to see the world and a space to see the misrepresentations of Arabs.\u201dIn that respect, video games may not have changed much. In 2003, an online game called Quest for Saddam was released. In six levels, players hunt down the former Iraqi president. In response, al-Qaeda released a modified version that changed the target to former U.S. president George W. Bush. Iraqi-born Wafaa Bilal presented his version of the game, The Night of Bush Capturing: A Virtual Jihad. The player is Bilal, who after learning that his brother is killed by American soldiers, becomes a suicide bomber on a mission. Bilal\u2019s game is meant to raise awareness not only of the stereotypical nature of war video games, but what it means to someone whose culture is constantly portrayed as the enemy. \u201cI wanted to reverse the role from the hunter to the hunted; to put the viewer in a different perspective,\u201d he says, insisting that it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as an anti-American game. \u201cThe job of the artist is not to make a statement, but to build a platform.\u201dBilal\u2019s platform, along with Mohsen and Farocki\u2019s, will remain on display until the exhibit closes on March 2.

    "body": "Courtesy Nick DanzigerMariatu Kamara, whose hands were cut off during Sierra Leone's civil war, is among 11 women  portrayed by British photojournalist Nick Danziger.  A young woman poses in front of the camera, wearing a dress patterned with leaves and branches and a simple chain around her neck. She looks off into the distance, leaning against a post and supporting her chin with her arm, cut off just below the wrist. \r\rNow in her mid-20s, Mariatu Kamara lives in Toronto, but this photo was taken shortly after a group of young soldiers attacked her and cut off both of her hands with a machete during the decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone. Kamara, then 13, was found and brought to live at a camp with other amputees, including children as young as two. In 2001, British author and photojournalist Nick Danziger photographed Kamara and 10 other women affected by armed conflict in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Colombia, Gaza, and Israel for the International Committee of the Red Cross. In 2008, he embarked on a three-year journey to photograph them again. Danziger tracked down each woman except for one: 10-year-old Mah-Bibi, an orphan living in a refugee camp in Afghanistan with her two younger brothers. She had died in 2006 at the age of 15. Danziger\u2019s photographs (black and white from 2001 and colour from 2011), along with short films in which Kamara, Mah-Bibi and nine others deliver first-hand accounts of their lives, will be on display at the Canadian War Museum from Feb. 8 to April 21 in an exhibit called Eleven Women Facing War. Danziger has long used his talents to bring attention to those affected by conflict. His exhibit Missing Lives, which followed the attempts of 15 families to find lost loved ones after war ravaged the Balkans in the 1990s, appeared at the war museum in 2011. Danziger has described how his exhibits pay tribute to victims of conflict and the families of the dead and missing who want their stories told. On his website, Danziger says he hopes the testimony of the women he photographed for Eleven Women Facing War \u201cwill help put a face to all those who continue to suffer in silence.\u201d Andrew Burtch, a post-1945 historian at the war museum, says the stories of the women presented in the exhibit are ultimately stories of conflicts that have affected much larger groups of people. \"It will be an informative exhibition, but it's very much an intimate one,\" Burtch says.\u201cVisitors are going to encounter these women\u2019s stories and walk away understanding a little bit more about what people in different parts of the world go through,\u201d Burtch says. Carleton University sociology professor Augustine Park says it\u2019s important that exhibits such as this empower women by placing their voices at the centre, enabling them to articulate their own stories and solutions. Park says the personal, biographical nature of the exhibit speaks to audiences in ways that \u201canonymous\u201d images of women in war cannot. She plans on bringing her graduate students to the exhibit to discuss the difference between voyeurism and bearing witness to other people\u2019s suffering via photography. Burtch says the overall message of the exhibit is one of resiliency, and one that many Canadians can relate to. \u201cWar has shaped Canada,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the stories told here can relate to instances where new Canadians have arrived (here) fleeing conflict, where conflict has had a role in shaping their lives and their worlds.\u201d Kamara knows what it means to live a life irrevocably altered by armed conflict. She is now an author and a UNICEF Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict, and will be amongst those celebrating the Canadian debut of Eleven Women Facing War. \u201cAn eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind. My plan is to make life go forward,\u201d Kamara told Kitchener newspaper The Record in 2011.\u00a0 And she has. ",

The building was without reliable hot water for three brief stretches of time\u00a0 in November, December and early January, says Poirier, blaming an old, failing boiler for the problem.\u00a0\u00a0 Some residents dispute that, saying the trouble lasted longer and was a significant inconvenience.Ann Swackhamer says cold water poured onto her body whenever she tried taking a shower between the end of November to around Christmas Eve. \u201cI suffered through it because I needed to take a shower,\u201d she says.Swackhamer says OCHC officials\u2019 advice to boil water on a stove and fill the bathtub during the hot water outage was not helpful for her. \u201cI can\u2019t lift anything heavy, or else my knees will buckle, and my back will be in a lot of...pain,\u201d she says.Swackhamer says she has severe arthritis, back and knee problems. Alternatives to showering included scrubbing her body with a sponge, she says. \u201cI know it\u2019s been difficult,\u201d Poirier concedes.But she insists \u201cit\u2019s not accurate that there was no hot water for over a month... At times during peak demand, it was very difficult to get hot water.\u201d\u00a0 Swackhamer says tenants living on the upper floors did get hot water from time to time, but her floor, which is on the fifth, did not.\u201cIt was only cold, cold, cold.\u201dNow, says Poirier, the old boiler has new valves to help generate hot water, \u201cbut we are not taking a chance\u201d that the fix will last. She says she\u2019s waiting for consultants to give a timeline to replace the water-heating system. Despite OCHC\u2019s financial challenges, Poirier says the agency\u00a0 has set aside money for the replacement plan. The OCHC will pay for a new boiler through continued low-interest mortgages from Infrastructure Ontario, and will seek for grants from other levels of government, she says. But Poirier says potential problems at the corporation\u2019s huge stock of social housing remain a concern because of hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred maintenance costs that have accumulated over the years.In 2008, a report showed that the OCHC had accumulated about $332 million in deferred maintenance costs for its 15,000 homes scattered across Ottawa, according to a third-party building assessment. The study, carried out by the international engineering and construction company Conestoga-Rovers & Associates, concluded that more government was required to overcome years of deferred maintenance on OCHC buildings.The OCHC was formed in 2002 following a merger of two previous social housing providers in Ottawa.The report recommended that the backlog of maintenance work meant the OCHC needed to invest about $60 million per year to catch up with building upgrades, such as installing energy-efficient toilets, Poirier says. However, the OCHC could not gather that much money, she says. This year, the OCHC will be spending about $30 million to maintain and update the housings, she says. \u201cBut at some point in time,\u201d Poirier acknowledges, \u201cwe need a long-term strategy and additional funding to fix the problem once and for all.\u201d ",

    "body": "A proposal for high-rise buildings in Little Italy is making residents and business owners fearful that the buildings will overtake the low-rise areas, but the project\u2019s designer says the proposal will encourage growth in the neighbourhood. \r\rGeorge Dark, an urban designer from Urban Strategies Inc. in Toronto, wants to build new roads along the O-Train tracks, construct nine-storey buildings along the tracks west of Preston Street, build 40-storey high-rises along Carling Avenue and 18-storey high-rises along Rochester Street. He says building high-rises and new roads will make Little Italy a \u201cvery intriguing place\u201d for people. He says the plan will make the area \u201ca place in the city that\u2019s very ripe.\u201dBut residents and business owners are worried that nine-storey buildings could overtake the low-lying residential areas and that roads could be built near the O-Train tracks.Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes says Little Italy does not need more roads. \u201cThere\u2019s the ability for hundreds of new residents to come into the area,\u201d she says. This means public transit needs to be encouraged to keep cars off the road. \u201cIn theory we would want people accessing that transit station by walking, cycling and transit,\u201d Holmes says.Joe Cotroneo, vice-chair of the Preston Street BIA and owner of Pub Italia in Little Italy, agrees. \u201cHere they are preaching they want no more cars in the core, yet they are going to build more roads,\u201d he says.Another concern is constructing nine-storey buildings just west of Preston Street. While Cotroneo says he doesn\u2019t mind high-rises on Carling, he says building in the residential area could \u201cspoil the district.\u201dConstructing nine-storey buildings will \u201cundermine the residential community.\u201dIt is a significant part of Little Italy. It has a cultural and historical importance to the area, Holmes says Michael Powell, president of the Dalhousie Community Association, says a main drawing factor to the neighbourhood is the low-rise feel. Cotroneo says having high-rises anywhere in the neighbourhood will create a \u201ctunnel of shade\u201d and will \u201cdiscourage patios and pedestrian traffic.\u201dWhile designer Dark has faced much criticism about his plan, he says he has taken the concerns into account. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t see the entire area get converted randomly into high-rise buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cThat would be the last thing I would do.\u201dDark says he has carefully considered where to put the high-rise buildings, but more important, where not to put them. Despite worry from residents that Dark is from out of town, he says he has worked in Ottawa for the last 15 years and is in the city almost every week. \u201cI don\u2019t usually bring a Toronto-based response to the cities we\u2019re working in, because it wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says.Cotroneo is more skeptical, saying Dark\u2019s plan could be the end of Little Italy.

    "body": "Erin Morawetz, Centretown NewsVaughn MacDonald, owner of Black Squirrel Books & Tea, says that although a third of his customers use credit cards, he will keep prices the way they are.  In the wake of an increase in fees small businesses pay for accepting MasterCard, several merchants in Centretown nonetheless say they don\u2019t intend to raise prices in the near future.\r\rThe Canadian Federation of Independent Business announced Jan. 4 that MasterCard Canada plans to increase its \u201cassessment fee\u201d on payment transactions 20 per cent to 7.7 basis points, which works out to a fraction of one per cent, starting July 1. Some of Centretown\u2019s small merchants were disgruntled, saying the fees are another obstacle to growing their businesses. \u201cThe first thing I thought was \u2018Geez, another increase, another fee that I have to pay,\u2019 \u201d says Kevin Martin, who owns Stroked Ego, a men\u2019s accessory store on Bank Street.Martin estimates 35 to 40 per cent of his customers use credit cards to pay and his debit and credit fees together totalled almost $1,000 in December.He says although the increase is a nuisance, it will only set him back about $5 per month making an increase in prices unnecessary. Like Martin, Vaughn MacDonald, who owns Black Squirrel Books on Bank Street, says about one-third of his customers choose credit when they get to the cash register.MacDonald says although he\u2019s not happy about the increase, it will not affect the prices of the books he sells.\u201cTwenty per cent is substantial for sure, but (the fees are) not impacting us a great deal yet anyway. I\u2019ll probably just let it slide,\u201d says MacDonald.\u00a0\u201cIf I was a business more heavily dependent on credit card transactions, I might feel different,\u201d he says.Some businesses will feel the sting more sharply. For example, Pub Italia relies heavily on credit cards as a method of payment.Owner Joe Cotroneo remembers operating 15 years ago when only 10 per cent of his customers used credit cards. Now about 90 per cent pull out plastic when they pay their tabs, he says.While he doesn\u2019t plan to change the prices on his menu quite yet, Cotroneo warns that the cost would eventually be passed down to the consumer.\u201cWhen the time comes that we\u2019re looking at price changes, it\u2019s one of the calculations that have to be taken into account,\u201d he says.Dan Kelly, president of the CFIB, says while 7.7 basis points is still just a fraction of a percent, the constant rate war between Visa and MasterCard irks him. Visa Canada plans to up assessment fees by one-third in April.\u201cThey tend to try to outdo each other and unfortunately we don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to be done,\u201d he says.At the moment, businesses are not permitted by credit card companies to charge a fee to accept the cards, but they can for debit.As a solution, Kelly suggests business owners join a CFIB awareness campaign to sway customers to pay using cash or debit. The federation has a sign on its website explaining to consumers the effect paying with credit has on smaller merchants. Kelly recommends merchants print it and display it.But not all business owners are comfortable directing their customers\u2019 method of payment.\u201cIt\u2019s the worst experience for a customer to make them feel bad for having to use their credit card,\u201d MacDonald says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because I don\u2019t want to prevent people from shopping in my store, so I don\u2019t want to sway them away from using a credit card,\u201d Martin says, \u201cbut if there\u2019s an option for us to get into the conversation then I definitely try to steer them subtly towards cash or debit.\u201dKelly says the campaign isn\u2019t for everyone, but it is one way to help avoid the added costs. In December 2010, the federal Competition Bureau asked\u00a0 the Competition Tribunal to rule on whether Visa and MasterCard are engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. The tribunal was supposed to make its ruling in December. A decision is expected soon.",

    "body": "The snowfalls that have blanketed Ottawa\u2019s streets so far this winter are not just stalling drivers. Several of the 300 local companies that specialize in removing and hauling snow are also spinning their wheels.\r\rThe businesses that plow Ottawa\u2019s streets are not just based in Ontario. Quebec companies also help to clear the capital\u2019s roads. Thirty-four companies \u2013 roughly 10 per cent of municipal snow haulers \u2013 come from outside Ontario. This external help is only acceptable if Ottawa\u2019s trucks are given the same courtesy just across the river. However, they are not.When Ottawa plows head to Quebec, the local police are strict with out-of-towners, says Ron Barr, general manager of the Greater Ottawa Truckers Association. Barr\u2019s organization represents nearly 1,000 Eastern Ontario truck drivers. In Quebec, police often pull over these Ontario drivers and force them to leave if the truckers don\u2019t have the paperwork declaring that they can work in the province. Some have even been thrown in jail. Barr calls this \u201charassment,\u201d although he says he doesn\u2019t\u00a0 blame Quebec authorities for protecting their workers. He says he regrets that Ontario cannot do the same. It is the city\u2019s duty to put forward regulations that protect local companies. By opening the border leniently to these competitors, Ottawa\u2019s snow hauling businesses lose revenue. In 2013, more than 300 local companies send shift workers to plow Ottawa\u2019s streets. This number is already high without additions from Quebec. Furthermore, the Ottawa area\u2019s streets are not cleared faster with more available firms. On the contrary, workers could clear out of their jobs if they are not getting enough shifts. Many wait weeks without a turn at the wheel during times of minimal snowfall.When double-digit-centimetres-worth of white dusts the town, the 330 or so companies that haul snow around Ottawa begin sending their trucks out. The first business notified to send out a truck, however, will then have to wait for the other 329 companies to send out workers of their own before getting another ring from the City. It would make more sense for the city to give an advantage to local workers. These external companies should only come in handy when Ottawa needs backup workers to help plow roads after a massive storm. To ensure that there is an equitable system that treats workers in both provinces fairly, the City of Ottawa may have to negotiate with the province. Ontario\u2019s Discriminatory Business Practices Act, which forbids discriminating based on geographic location, has defended Quebec workers from working outside of their province. There is no equivalent to the Discriminatory Business Practices Act in Quebec, Barr says.However, if one province has allowed regulations to ease work for others, then there should be discussion for a similar development for Ontario businesses in Quebec. Although recent labour agreements between the provinces have made it easier for some workers to work in Ontario and Quebec, not all trades have this advantage.Finding work in Quebec remains tough for some residents of Ottawa, who must obtain a union membership and pay a fee to work in Quebec. Meanwhile, Quebec firms can operate in Ottawa at the same rate as local companies. The City of Ottawa needs to push this issue forward immediately to ensure that there is a level playing field between the provinces. Until then, Ontario companies sit increasingly idle as their competition drives in to shovel up business. ",

    "body": "Recent changes to an immigration policy intended to improve labour shortages across Canada are getting mixed reviews from Centretown construction companies, whose concerns are far more complex than just needing more workers. \r\rThe new Federal Skilled Trades Program is designed to speed up the arrival of high-demand foreign tradespeople into Canada and ease reliance on temporary labour. Electricians, crane operators, and welders are among the 26 eligible in-demand jobs. With the new program, skilled trades applicants no longer have to meet the same criteria used for the rest of the federal skilled worker category.In Centretown, the recent construction boom signals a need for skilled workers. Bronson Avenue has been under construction since March, and new projects on Preston Street and Bronson Avenue are slated to reach record heights of more than 30 storeys. Centretown is the city\u2019s leader in high-rise development. In the last quarter of 2012, 193 multi-storey buildings were built in the neighbourhood. However, the Construction Sector Council indicates that the Canadian construction industry as a whole will need 320,000 new workers by 2020.Louis Dugan, project manager for Doran construction in Centretown, says the company specifically needs carpenters, one of the eligible positions in the new program. Dugan currently uses temporary labourers and says they must simplify tasks to use less experienced workers.\u201cMore skilled workers is a must,\u201d says Dugan. \u201cThere should be a lot more effort put into pushing kids into construction.\u201dHe adds that companies like PCL Construction have even gone overseas to supplement their workforce. \u201cThe population of tradespeople is aging, and young people are not necessarily joining those professions at the same rate they would\u2019ve in the past,\u201d says Michael Waters, president of Minto Communities Ontario.While Waters says he does not feel there is a severe labour shortage in Ottawa, the labour demands of large-scale infrastructure projects like the proposed light rail transit line could put pressure on the limited resources of Ottawa construction companies. He says he supports the new program, but has concerns over the ability of foreign workers to integrate into the Canadian workforce. Norman Bloom, owner of Centretown company Stonehenge Masonry, attributes the quality of local trades programs as the reason for his lack of staffing issues, saying that he hires most of his staff out of the Algonquin College masonry program. Jeff Clarke, section chairman for trade contractors for the Ottawa Construction Association, supports the changes but does not see the benefit for his company, Inflector Environmental Services. The company hires and trains all of their staff in Canada and has no need for foreign labour. In its first year, the immigration department will accept 3,000 applications for a total of 43 eligible jobs. The program will give points to applicants who have a job offer in Canada and have basic proficiency in French or English. Additionally, applicants must prove they have recently worked in the trade and have a minimum of two years\u2019 experience in the trade. ",

Although the Canadian penny is no longer produced, the coin is now the centre of a new exhibit at the Bank of Canada\u2019s Currency Museum on Sparks Street.\r\rCENTimental Journey showcases the penny\u2019s most important moments in history.Visitors will be able to see every penny design used in Canada. These include the pre-Confederation coins of France, Great Britain and the U.S., the first Canadian one-cent coin designed in 1858 with maple-leafed wreath, and the final penny minted in last May.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of history,\u201d says Raewyn Passmore, assistant curator at the museum. \u201cWe want to celebrate it before it is discontinued.\u201dIn May 2012, the federal government decreed that the penny would be withdrawn from circulation. The Royal Canadian Mint will stop distributing it on Feb. 4.Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said many consumers and retailers considered the penny an annoyance and the coin was cut for cost-saving reasons.The last penny was minted last May in Winnipeg and was struck by Flaherty. This penny was transferred back to the Bank of Canada for public display at the museum. \u201cWe want to make this coin available for people,\u201d says Passmore. \u201cThe penny is a pretty familiar coin to everybody and they might be surprised to find out how diverse and varied the penny really is.\u201dThe exhibit also includes a poster explaining the use, value and design of the penny throughout history.\u201cI hope visitors consider the importance of the penny,\u201d says Passmore. \u201cSome older generations can remember that they were able to buy candy and toys with a few pennies.\u201dIn the past, the penny was the main coin people used. According to Passmore, the penny was like a modern-day $20 bill.Montreal couple Madeleine and Rosaire Lariviere visited the museum on the exhibit\u2019s opening day and said it was worth the trip.\u201cThe origins and history of the older coins and pennies are interesting to see,\u201d says Rosaire Lariviere. As visitors enter the museum, a wall-length mural of the pennies greets them. In the design of a modern penny, the mural is constructed from tarnished, older pennies donated to the museum by friends, and newer pennies donated by the mint.The mural is currently missing one penny, which will be placed by the winner of an essay contest the museum held in December for Ottawa Grade 4 and 5 students. Sean Isaacs, professional coin dealer at Alliance Coin and Banknote, says it is important to celebrate the penny. \u201cThe legacy of our one cent coin is a long and distinguished one. Everything we price, sell and spend had its very foundation build upon the penny and halfpennies of pre-Confederation Canada,\u201d says Isaacs.When the exhibit ends, Passmore says the coins on display will become part of the national currency collection. CENTimental Journey runs until July 2 at the Currency Museum of the Bank of Canada, located at 245 Sparks St. Admission is free for all visitors. ",

The emergence of a growing restaurant marketplace in Centretown has observers noticing an increase in growth in other sectors of the area\u2019s business landscape as well. \r\rThe opening of establishments such as Burgers on Main and 327 Wine Bar, both on Somerset Street West and the arrival of the much-anticipated The 3 Brewers on the corner of Bank and Sparks streets, has secured Centretown\u2019s position as the premier destination for Ottawa foodies. This has many people hoping these new establishments can bring a financial boom to other businesses as well. Gerry LePage, executive director of the Bank Street BIA, says this is a trend he is very happy to see.\u201cWe\u2019ve been noticing this more and more,\u201d LePage says. \u201cNew restaurants in the area and excitement over the ones to come \u2013 the opening of Fauna, across from the Whalesbone on Bank Street comes to mind \u2013 have really increased people\u2019s attraction to the area. Increased competition ultimately leads to consumer benefit and people want to go where they\u2019ll benefit the most. Right now, that\u2019s Centretown and that means better results for all businesses, not just the restaurants and bars.\u201d Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes says she has noticed the same emerging trend. She points to The 3 Brewers, a microbrewery-restaurant where the brewers work within sight of diners, as one establishment that is playing a pivotal role. \u201cThat street corner used to be a quiet block,\u201d she says. \u201cNow look at it. The area north of Gloucester Street can do with a lot more traffic, especially at night. We\u2019re seeing these restaurants attract that traffic so I think it will definitely help other businesses in the area.\u201d LePage relates the emergence of this trend with a surge in Centretown\u2019s development. He says that not only has there been a number of new and soon-to-open restaurants, but the new condominiums going up also serve as kindling for the fire of Centretown business. \u201cAll the new development has been a response to favourable market conditions,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cMany of the condo dwellers will be double income families with no children, a perfect demographic for the restaurant business.\u201d Holmes agrees, saying that hundreds of more residents can only add to the surge she is already witnessing. \u201cI spoke to many businesses over the holidays and they had a very good Christmas financially,\u201d she says. \u201cI think in time, as the current trend continues, we\u2019ll see a lot of increased interest and success in Centretown.\u201d Even though the new development projects will introduce a new market to the area, perhaps the biggest asset to Centretown\u2019s businesses will be the restaurant industry\u2019s ability to attract non-residents. As he sips a brewed-on-site pint at the glass-encased 3 Brewers, Nic Minty, a Gloucester resident, says he could see how the trend was growing. \u201cI live in Gloucester, so I don\u2019t come downtown too often,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I lived in Montreal for a few years and The 3 Brewers is really popular there, so when I heard one opened up here in Ottawa I was pretty excited. \"It\u2019s my second time here already. The first time I came I brought my girlfriend and we ended up doing some shopping in the area afterwards. I wouldn\u2019t have even been downtown if it wasn\u2019t to come to the restaurant.\u201d ",

The Centretown programs are exactly why nutrition and healthy living programs should be offered at community centres, says Stefania Maggi, a psychology professor at Carleton University with an expertise in health. \u201cThe community centre is a lot more accessible and less expensive,\u201d she says.Both the craving-control program, starting in April, and the grocery store tour, on Feb. 11, are free.Maggi says it\u2019s often the case that people will simply stumble over these programs in their community and will start looking into them when they might not have had an interest before. The Cooper Street health centre also offers group cooking classes in which people can learn what foods are healthy and how to prepare easy meals. \u201cWhen you pair nutrition with these basic skills, you can really see the change,\u201d says Maggi.

A group of students from Lisgar Collegiate are continuing their national winning streak after advancing to the final rounds of several Canadian quiz tournaments with further competition scheduled in the United States.\r\rLisgar teams placed both first and second in the Ottawa Quizbowl Tournament in November, eclipsing the competition from Colonel By Secondary School, Earl of March Secondary School and Nepean Secondary School. The finals will see the team travel to Atlanta for the National Academic Quiz Tournament in March, one of only two Canadian teams to ever compete in the American contest. The team will also travel to the University of Maryland to participate in the Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence tournament in June, competing against the top 50 teams in the U.S. With a strong gifted student program that makes up one third of the student population, Lisgar is one of Ottawa\u2019s best-performing high schools. November saw the team take both the Canadian and International Title for PBS\u2019s television quiz show Whiz Quiz. \u201cThey have a very successful history in the last decade. The team was revived in the 1990s and yes, they\u2019ve done an excellent job,\u201d says Ruth Crabtree, mentor to the Lisgar team since 1999. Under Crabtree\u2019s guidance, the Lisgar team was the first Canadian school to travel to the United States to participate the in National Academic Quiz Tournament championships in 2006. In 2008, it captured the Reach for the Top national title.\u201cA big part of it is selecting the right combination of players and molding them into a team.\u201d Crabtree says.Crabtree says the group practices together at least three times a week in preparation for the upcoming tournaments. They train online and go through past questions, creating their own quiz material as preparation. The team members are all avid readers which benefits them during tournaments, Crabtree says. \u201cSome of them are definitely sponges, they just soak up information. That\u2019s their strength and it serves them very well in this form of competition.\u201d she says. The Lisgar team consists of about 30 members and a core team of 10 to 12 students, ranging in age from 14 to 17. When at a tournament, Lisgar is represented by a squad of four or five players. Several members plan to continue taking part in similar tournaments through college.

Local sports bar managers say business will recover and boom while the Ottawa Senators continue their season after opening on Jan. 19.\r\r\"On the nights the Senators are playing, we\u2019re going to have twice as much business as before,\" says Matthew Valentine, general manager of Real Sports Bar & Grill on George Street, which opened in the midst of the NHL lockout in November. \"That\u2019s just being conservative.\" Players, team owners and league bosses resolved a dispute about revenue-sharing on Jan. 6, but lost 34 of 82 regular season games after more than 100 days of failure to reach an agreement.Since the appeal of a new bar with a 27-foot television lured patrons to Real Sports, Valentine says the lockout didn\u2019t harm its revenue as much as other bars.The James Street Pub in Centretown, on the corner of Bank and James St., is aiming to recover from a revenue loss of more than 20 per cent between October and December this year compared to last, says Alex Munro, vice-president of business operations and development at Heart and Crown Irish Pubs, which owns James Street.Though NFL games and Ultimate Fighting Championship matches still draw crowds, Munro says more people show up to buy food and drinks for Senators games.That is especially true when they play rival teams such as the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs.\"Because we were making less money, we had staff working significantly less hours,\" he says. \"Especially around Christmas time, that\u2019s never good.\"He would have laid off employees if the lockout had gone another couple of weeks, he adds. Though he says sales and workers\u2019 hours will return to normal soon, fans who plan to \"boycott\" NHL hockey could continue to threaten business. Those who vowed to ignore the NHL may have a hard time if their friends are fans, though.\"I don\u2019t really care about hockey right now. I\u2019m still mad about the lockout,\" says Dylan Haggart, a Carleton University communications student. \"But I guess I\u2019m kind of a hypocrite, because I have plans to go to bars with friends to grab a pint and watch the game.\"Haggart, a Maple Leafs fan, says last NHL season he found opportunities to catch his favourite team play and even watched Senators games at pubs like the Royal Oak and The Barley Mow most weekends. During the lockout, he says he only went to the bars \"once or twice.\"\"There\u2019s not really a true replacement for NHL hockey,\" says Gyneya Dicks, manager of Hooley\u2019s Pub on Elgin Street. Last season \"people would come in, watch the hockey game and stay after to have another beer.\"As a condensed schedule sees teams play one more game than usual every few weeks, Dicks says she\u2019s confident business will recover from the lockout since fans have more opportunities to watch a game.But if the Senators can\u2019t slip into the playoffs like last season, Dicks says revenue will tumble again.For now, Munro says he\u2019s looking forward to seeing the James Street Pub full for at least three months of hockey.\"It\u2019s in our DNA \u2013 especially Ottawa being such a great hockey city \u2013 when Hockey Night in Canada is on TV, the pub is full and everyone is having a great time,\" he says. \"It\u2019s an incredible feeling, which we haven\u2019t seen in a while.\"",

    "body": "With the release of the analysis of Junior Seau\u2019s brain, concussions and a whole host of brain injuries caused by sports are forcing their way back in to the spotlight for the awareness they deserve.\r\rThe tradition of cheering players for big hits needs to change, and fans need to understand and support that.Seau was a former NFL linebacker who played 20 years in the National Football League, retiring in 2010. In his time as a player, he was a 10-time All-Pro selection, a 12-time Pro-Bowl selection and was a two time champion in the AFC with the San Diego Chargers.In short, he was a phenomenal player. Yet sadly, he committed suicide at his home in May 2012.Off the field, he could hide the depression and anger in public. In his private life, his ex-wife and son told CBS News about Seau\u2019s descent in to irrational mood swings and bouts of depression that became more apparent as time went on.His family decided to donate his brain to the National Institutes of Health, to study whether his suicide was at all linked with hits to his head.On Jan. 13, his family released the hospital\u2019s findings. Seau\u2019s brain had been decimated by chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by years of hits to the head. On Wednesday, the family announced it was filing a wrongful death suit against the NFL.Side effects for Seau included depression and mood swings, as well as insomnia.As happened when Dave Duerson, who formerly played for the Chicago Bears, and Ray Easterling, a former player with the Atlanta Falcons, committed suicide after suffering through years of head trauma, fans and administrators all rush to offer various solutions.Some, like me, yearn to see a change. Research published by Boston University\u2019s Centre for the Study of Traumatic Encepholaphy has studied the brains of 85 athletes and war veterans with histories of head trauma. Researchers examined the brains of 34 professional footballers to determine the long term effects of head trauma. The worrying stat for football? Thirty-three out of 34 were diagnosed with CTE. Simply put, the brain isn\u2019t made for ferocious hits to the head. According Dr. Michael Vassilyadi, a neurosurgeon with the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, an adult skull has roughly the thickness of three stacked pennies. That\u2019s all that exists to protect your brain outside of a helmet.Where does this leave football right now?In 2012, the NFL released new rules protecting any defenceless players from being hit above the shoulder, even if that means using their shoulder pads or helmets to do so. This is a step in the right direction. Where should it lead? Fines and lengthy suspensions if a player commits an illegal hit to the head.Players should no longer be commended for bone crunching hits, as a sign of toughness, but punished for them.But this is also where it heads into problems. Go to any sports bar, or crowd around any television to watch a football (or hockey) game and you\u2019ll hear people whine and complain about referees who call any perceived dangerous hits.Fans of contact sports \u2013 whether it be hockey, football or even rugby \u2013 are also their greatest enemy.They have no desire to see their favourite sports lose their toughness.They cheer the big potentially injury causing hits, and applaud the players who are willing to throw themselves headfirst into a tackle. The usual words of \"commitment\" or \"bravery\" are bandied about and used to excuse players who commit these acts.How do you balance player safety in contact sports with the old guard of fans who dislike seeing changes to their game?It has come to a point where you don\u2019t. Now is the time when you become willing to sacrifice fan revenue to make a point about player safety. If fans start complaining that the game is becoming \"soft\" or officials are too quick to call penalties then tough luck. That\u2019s the way the game should be played from now on. Player safety comes first.Seau was not the first to suffer from CTE in professional football player, but can hopefully be one of the last.",

When Kwesi Loney was introduced as technical director of the Ottawa Fury boys prospect program Jan. 1, he came one step closer to accomplishing a particularly lofty personal goal: resurrecting Canadian soccer. \r\r\"The state of soccer in this country is abysmal,\" Loney says. \"I want to raise the profile of soccer not just here, but everywhere in Canada. This new position can help me do that.\"As technical director, Loney is in charge of overseeing the program for the Fury boys between the ages of 8 and 12. That includes developing a curriculum for the program, watching over coaches, keeping up with parents and scheduling tournaments.Loney moved into coaching seven years ago after a successful university playing career in which he captained the Carleton Ravens to an Ontario University Athletics silver medal, was selected as an All-Canadian and represented Canada at the University Games in 2003.Starting as a youth coach with the Ottawa Fury, Loney says he didn\u2019t have plans about going into off-the-field management, but he knew that the best way to improve the visibility of soccer in the country was to work with children and develop their skills.Loney says he only realized how much the Fury\u2019s development program could help him in accomplishing his goal when, four years ago, he decided to accept an offer to become the assistant coach of the Carleton Ravens.\"I saw some of the players that I coached at the youth level getting to play at the university stage,\" Loney says. \"It was an eye-opening experience for me.\"Fury owner John Pugh echoed those thoughts.\"The prospect program is the bedrock of all our programs,\" Pugh says. \"Kids that go through it are better prepared and develop into better soccer players.\"Although he considered several candidates after former technical director John Whiting stepped down from the position for family reasons, Pugh says it didn\u2019t take him long to realize that Loney was the perfect man for the job.He says Loney was chosen because he is a great communicator who is \"particularly adept\" at dealing with children.But even more than that, Loney has proven he\u2019s a winner.Most significantly for the club, Loney was an integral part of the coaching staff that brought the Fury women\u2019s team its elusive first W-League championship last season. \"He\u2019s on a roll,\" Pugh says. \"It was not a difficult decision to appoint Kwesi to look after the boys\u2019 side of the prospect program.\"According to Carleton Ravens head coach Sandy Mackie, the importance of the W-League championship can\u2019t be overstated. He says the win has helped to establish Ottawa in the soccer world. He added that a championship team has also made the Fury \"well known, not just in Ottawa, but nationally. (The championship) has brought a lot of positives to soccer in the Ottawa area.\"Joey Kewin, who plays for both the Fury and the Ravens, agrees.\"I thought (the hiring) was a great step in the right direction for the Ottawa Fury,\" Kewin says. \"It all channels up once you have the great staff in place at the youth level. It translates up all through the club. It will pay off in years to come.\"However, Loney isn\u2019t ready to think about winning more championships just yet.He says he wants to set goals for the organization on a year-by-year basis. He says that, right now, he is more concentrated on molding the program in his own image.\"I\u2019m happy that I can apply some of the philosophies of the coaches that coached me had.\"The Fury boys U-13 team will begin play in June, looking to improve on last season's fourth place finish.",

    "body": "Erin Morawetz, Centretown NewsThe city's heritage committee has approved the demolition of the European Glass and Paint building at the corner of Bank and Flora streets after a proposal to incorporate elements of the existing structure in the new development was deemed too difficult and expensive. The City of Ottawa\u2019s built heritage advisory committee has approved the demolition of an old commercial building in Centretown that heritage advocates had originally hoped could be incorporated into a new, nine-storey structure slated for the corner of Bank and Flora streets.\r\rIn a unanimous vote on Jan. 17, the committee agreed that the building \u2013 located at 488-500 Bank Street and which was the longtime home of European Glass and Paint \u2013 can be removed and replaced with the planned mixed-use structure. According to a report in December, the building will include retail stores on the ground level and condominiums on the upper floors. The decision comes after the March 2012 submission of a controversial original plan to construct the new building using entirely contemporary materials such as glass and steel. The plan did not meet with positive feedback from many members of the community, as it didn\u2019t match Bank Street\u2019s brick-clad streetscape, heritage planner Sally Coutts said at the committee meeting.Members of the Centretown Citizens Community Association were divided on the proposed project, said association vice-president Rob Dekker. \"We were hoping to see some historical design aspects incorporate Bank Street into the building with some brick cladding,\" he said. The association is, generally, in favour of the proposed development on Bank Street, said Dekker, also addressing the importance of the new influx of residents that would be moving into the building, and contributing to the revitalization of Centretown and the environmentally-friendly intensification of Ottawa\u2019s downtown population.The association submitted comments asking for some adjustments to the project to make the final design more consistent with Bank\u2019s streetscape, and Dekker said he\u2019s hopeful that Urban Capital, the developers, will take that viewpoint into consideration. FOTENN urban design has been involved in planning at the site and has taken the community\u2019s comments into consideration, said urban planner Sarah Millar Martin. The backlash from the community prompted the creation of a revised plan that was submitted in December to accommodate the needs of the building from a heritage standpoint, she said.Not only has brick cladding been added to the new plan, but also an increased chamfer, which is a symmetrical sloping edge on the building\u2019s northeast corner, said Millar Martin. The chamfer was added to replicate the look of the building\u2019s predecessor, she said. Some members of the community have expressed their support for the project. It is an underutilized site, says Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes, noting that the building was in poor condition prior to the redevelopment proposal.It\u2019s because of this that heritage should not take precedence over development, she says, suggesting that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the developers. \"The project will help enliven Bank Street,\" says Holmes.It was initially recommended that, in keeping with the spirit of the heritage district, features of the existing structure should be incorporated into the new building, according to a city report. City heritage staff originally pushed the developers to consider this, said Millar Martin.But upon consultation with the developer and further examination of the site, it was decided the building was not in adequate condition to be retained in a larger project, according to the report.

    "body": "Braedon Clark, Centretown NewsDundonald Park on Somerset Street West is one of the most underused parks in Ottawa. A year-long revitalization effort aimed at making Centretown\u2019s Dundonald Park a safer, more vibrant hub for the community is nearing completion. \r\rA report produced by Toronto-based 8-80 Cities, which will examine why Dundonald Park is falling below community expectations and how it can be improved, will be released by the end of February. The report is part of 8-80\u2019s Make a Place for People project, which has been assessing eight Ontario parks identified as falling short of their potential. \"Parks should be overflowing with activity; they should be the best, most vibrant places in our communities,\" says Emily Munroe, the non-profit\u2019s director of partnerships and programs. Dundonald Park, she says, is underperforming even though it\u2019s one of Centretown\u2019s few green public spaces. Centretown only has 4.6 square metres of park for every resident, 29.7 sq. m below the city\u2019s average, according to The University of Ottawa\u2019s Neighbourhood Study. Even for a downtown area, this is a low number. Many residents, however, believe that despite the shortage, Dundonald Park is being underutilized. Munroe says that it\u2019s because of safety. Last year, police reported that Dundonald Park was one of Ottawa\u2019s least safe public spaces, largely due to groups of men and women who gathered in the summer, many attracted by the Beer Store located across Somerset Street in the park\u2019s northern side. While there haven\u2019t been any instances of violence, the perceived danger has been enough to scare away many Centretown residents.Christina Marchant, the Centretown Community Health Centre\u2019s director of community health promotion and early years, says that simply removing people from the park isn\u2019t the answer. \"For some people who are homeless, that\u2019s their living room. We have no interest in saying get out of your living room.\"Marchant says if more people are in the park, everyone will feel safer. That\u2019s why, more than a year ago, her organization applied to be part of the Make a Place for People project. In assessing Dundonald Park, 8-80 Cities organized surveys, community meeting and workshops to find out how the park was being used and who was using it. It determined that in the past year women only made up 38 per cent of the 2,000 recorded uses. This, says Munroe, is a problem. \"If you consistently see more men than women in a space, often that points to the fact that the space is considered unsafe,\" Also underrepresented in the park were older adults, although Munroe says that it\u2019s hard to tell if this is a result of safety concerns or a lack of friendly infrastructure. She says public washrooms would make the park more accessible to older residents. Aside from the washrooms, she suggested additions such as portable chairs, extra bicycle parking, and even a water fountain. But Marchant says the CCHC will not be recommending any physical changes to the park. Munroe says that 8-80 Cities does not pay for the changes it recommends. In order to fund infrastructural changes, the CCHC would have to find investors or apply for grants. This doesn\u2019t mean the CCHC won\u2019t follow any of the report's other recommendations, such as finding more volunteers and using more social media advertising, but the decisions will have to wait until the end of February.

The core tunnel will run between Lebreton Flats and Rockcliffe Park and will intersect with a tunnel under Kent and Slater streets.These two tunnels total six kilometres in length, providing 42,000 cubic metres of storage.The project was expected to cost $140-million in 2009, but that estimate was adjusted to $170-million in 2012. Due to inflation, the cost of the project is projected to rise an additional $15-$20 million by the time it\u2019s completed in 2018.According to Dixon Weir, general manager of the city\u2019s environmental services division, increasing land costs are driving the inflation. \"This project is not static,\" says Weir. \"The increase in cost is the result of the project moving from its conceptual design to projected inflation and the completion of its environmental assessment and its functional design.\"The city is seeking one-third funding contributions from both the federal and provincial governments for the construction of the tunnel, according to Weir. The City of Ottawa will provide the remaining one-third.However, Wayne Newell, general manager of the city\u2019s infrastructure services department, says until a stable budget is complete, obtaining funding from the provincial and federal governments will be difficult.\"When we started this project, we were only figuring out estimates. The problem with providing numbers is that people gravitate to them, because it\u2019s the cost that they relate to.\".Newell says environmental services staff would draft a budget that accounts for the cost of inflation and addresses any additional, projected construction expenses.Meredith Brown, executive director of Ottawa Riverkeeper, says the Ottawa River Action Plan is crucial to its clean up strategy and should move forward with the tunnel project.Newell said a concrete overview of the project at each stage, provided by environmental services, would help Ottawa residents comprehend the importance of the project and its funding.",

By December 2012, there were 50 incidents reported and 23 people were banned for misconduct, according to a report presented at the library board meeting.\"Our security guards are looking for a disturbance,\" says MacGregor. \"They are looking for people being too loud, looking for people who are damaging the collections, and making sure no one is disrupting the flow of the library.\"\u00a0When library visitors or users violate the library\u2019s code of conduct, they are asked to leave.

Rainer Bloess.At the September meeting of the transit commission, Bloess asked the commission to investigate the costs of installing garbage receptacles in bus shelters.The response to that inquiry, which appeared on the agenda for the Jan. 16 meeting of the commission, states: \u201cThe cost of installing a garbage receptacle at all shelters is estimated at $1.5 million. This estimate includes the cost of the garbage receptacle, preparation of the site, labour and installation materials.\u201dThe report also states that a one-time cost of $500,000 would be incurred for the purchase of two garbage collection vehicles that would service the shelters, bringing the total cost of implementation to approximately $2 million.As well, city staff estimates the cost of sending staff to clean the shelters would be $450,000 annually.Bloess says he feels as though the report doesn\u2019t account for the work that is currently being done to clean shelters. \u201cMy first reaction was that it was kind of incredulous that numbers like this would come out.\u201d There are already garbage cans attached to benches outside of some shelters that are paid for by advertisers, Bloess says. As well, \u201cfor them to say, \u2018we\u2019ll need two garbage trucks to service this . . . \u2019 we have vehicles out there already going to every shelter every week, in some cases more frequently. There seems to be almost a reluctance here to address this issue,\u201d he says.\u201cMy goal is to increase the service standards without increasing the existing budget, which I think is possible.\u201d Financial costs aside, the report states that the installation of garbage receptacles could increase vandalism in bus shelters and that \u201ccustomers could experience discomfort due to odours or smell, even with regular removal and disinfection.\u201dHowever, some Centretown residents disagree with this assessment.\u201cGarbage doesn\u2019t smell worse on the floor or in a can, I would appreciate it if there were a garbage can,\u201d says Patrick Schmidt, 26, a university exchange student from Germany.Centretown resident Jacob D\u2019Aloisio, 20, says the garbage is something he doesn\u2019t pay attention to because it is so commonplace.\u201cAs long as the benches are clean it doesn\u2019t bother me, but I can\u2019t really see a garbage can being a bad thing to have in (the shelters),\u201d he says.But the report states that \u201cthe addition of a receptacle within the shelter may result in less functional space for all customers, including those who use mobility and assistive devices.\u201d\u201dThe numbers don\u2019t add up and the rationale doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d says Bloess.

He says that while these meetings are not public, and details on interested companies are not being released, there has already been significant interest from the real estate industry in the opportunity.The NCC controls numerous downtown properties, including green spaces along major routes such as Bronson, Wellington, and Somerset, says Pelletier. The federal agency also owns 34 properties with street addresses in Centretown.Many of these addresses are heritage sites, such as 555 Wellington St. on the shore of the Ottawa River, home to Ottawa\u2019s oldest mill \u2013 built in 1842 \u2013and recently redeveloped by the Mill Street Brewery.Brewery co-founder Steve Abrams says leasing that location from the NCC came with certain limitations, but was well worth the opportunity of operating in such a historic building.\u201cWe fell in love with the building from the moment we saw it because of the historical significance, the beauty of the location, and how well preserved it was,\u201d he says. \u201cThe NCC has done a great job maintaining it.\u201dHe says before Mill Street moved into the location there were certain NCC checks that needed to be complied with, such as bilingual menus and signage, and access to the second floor for disabled people, which meant installation of an elevator and shaft.\u201cOnce we got deeper in, we realized there was more to it than taking over a building,\u201d he says.Still, he credits the NCC and its leasing regulations for the beautiful condition of the building, and says that while Mill Street is only approaching the first year of its 10-year lease, the company is very happy with the arrangement.Another notable property is the Bronson Company Office on 150 Middle St., Victoria Island, on the register of Canada\u2019s Historic Places for the company\u2019s role in developing hydroelectricity in Ottawa in the 1800s. Proposals were collected for leasing that property last October.Victoria Island, an historic gathering ground for First Nations people in the Ottawa area, has been at the centre of Idle No More aboriginal protests in recent weeks, and is the site where Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence has been carrying out her liquid-diet \u201chunger strike.\u201d In early January, an NCC spokesperson told the Ottawa Citizen that, \u201ctypically, people who want to use our land require a permit, but the NCC has always worked with aboriginal groups to try and give them that space to express themselves, and we are continuing to do so in this situation.\u201dPelletier says another purpose of the industry sessions is to receive rental business advice on how to consolidate the NCCs\u2019 six property groups \u2014 residential, commercial, agricultural, land, institutional, and recreational \u2014 into two: residential and commercial.Pelletier says this grouping is common practice within the industry, and will be new practice for the NCC.\u201cWe\u2019re always trying to improve the way we work, our efficiency, and our effectiveness in the management of our properties,\u201d he says.Details of the current contract with Del Management, which ends March 31, 2014, are confidential, says Del Management chief operating officer Robb Watt.Likewise, the potential value of the upcoming contract is not available. Pelletier says releasing the current contract\u2019s value could influence the next step in the NCCs\u2019 process of finding a rental manager, which will be a request for proposals beginning this spring. \u00a0",

    "body": "ImageConst. Khoa N. Hoang The\u00a0 holiday season is officially over\u00a0 but\u00a0 sadly the month of December saw two people killed in New York City when they were shoved in front of speeding trains. The most recent victim was a 41-year-old man, killed Dec. 28 after being pushed by an unknown woman, who has now been arrested.\r\rEven more startling was the description by witnesses of a female   suspect in her 20s, who many described as appearing mentally ill. Police   are still trying to piece together what happened and the suspect   managed to evade capture. Newspapers after newspapers had no problems   finding enough people to talk about what they saw. Witnesses came   forward to talk to reporters, all of them with vivid recollections of   what happened. Many of them described that the woman appeared   distraught, nervous, and simply out of it before she killed the man.But   none of them called police with their concerns, nobody cared enough to   warn the man standing next to her, and nobody stepped in to stop her   from simply walking away after killing an innocent person. Our society   is becoming disconnected, preferring to rely more on public servants and   less of each other as fellow citizens. We have become reliant on   someone else to solve our problems and taking less ownership of our own   roles as part of the solution.Depression and anxiety has shifted   focus from lifestyle and upbringing to become one of the highest rates   of drug prescriptions in our city.\u00a0 Alcoholism and gambling addiction  is  now argued as a medical condition. Everyone is looking for someone   else, something else, to fix their problems. Children are no longer   hearing that \u201cyou can be whatever you want\u201d but instead they are   observing too many peers and parents blame others for their problems.   This is an unhealthy and troubling practice.That helpless victim   mentality has become a problem with so many of our population who lack   capacity to actively become part of their own solution. We know that   communities who do a good job at communicating with one another are more   quickly to mobilize to solve their own problems. Numerous studies have   shown that communities who play together stay together, have lower  rates  of families leaving the neighbourhood, and live healthier lives  with  lower levels of stress. They are the same communities that have  lower  crime rates because no one hesitates to take action where they  can and  call police when they can\u2019t. These communities have higher  property  values because there is a level of community pride, which also  comes  with the best standard of living because they can mobilize to  provide  the most opportunities to succeed for one another.Living  on my  street is an elderly neighbour whose husband died a few years  ago.\u00a0 She  lives alone and simply can not lift a shovel full of snow let  alone  clear the two-car driveway in front of her house.\u00a0 A snow  removal  company has been hired but they can\u2019t guarantee when their  services are  available, especially during those difficult days with  excessive  snowfall.\u00a0 So once I was done shovelling my driveway I walked  across the  street to hers, not because I had to or because she needed  me, but  because I can, I care, and I will.\u00a0 Our capacity lies within  what we are  able and willing to do.The NYPD has arrested that  5-foot-5 woman  in her 20s, actually 31 years old to be exact, who, in  front of  multiple witnesses managed to kill an unsuspecting man and  simply walk  away from a crowded New York City subway terminal without a  single  person intervening. I am not asking our citizens to become  police  officers but wish we took more pride in the community we lived  in, to do  our part in maintaining a safe place for our families and  empower each  other to do what we can.",

We worked hard to provide the same quality of experience as other years,\u201d he says. The unusually warm temperatures delayed the opening of the Snowflake Kingdom at Jacques-Cartier Park by 24 hours, but otherwise, Laflamme says, it was \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d If anything, the Rideau Canal Skateway benefited from the wet weather over the week, as the rain on Wednesday froze and provided an extra coat of ice for skaters, says Laflamme. Tourists and residents flocked to Confederation Park\u2019s Crystal Garden on Sunday for the 26th International Ice Carving Competition.

The proposal also eliminated temporary and season long passes, ending the discounts associated with those plans.Parks Canada states on its website that the planned fee increases are due to the fact that the costs for operating the canal lockage services are $18.5 million annually and that revenues from those services are equal to just 9.6 per cent of those costs, whereas roughly 35 per cent of operational costs are recovered at other Parks Canada operations.That proposed fee hike prompted an outcry from canal users, mayors in towns along the canal between Ottawa to Kingston, Dewar and Liberal Sen.

The government says it expects businesses to round purchases to the nearest five-cent increment, following the lead of countries such as Australia and New Zealand.Harmony Hawthorn, an employee at Planet Botanix on Bank Street, says rounding to the nearest five cents will take some getting used to. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re all comfortable with the idea yet, just because it\u2019s a strange concept to us all but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get used to it,\"he says. \u201cMy whole lifetime I\u2019ve had the penny, so rounding to the nearest five is going to be a very strange.\u201d Tom Gamble, owner of The Turning Point on Cooper Street, says the penny is a nuisance.However he says he\u2019s noticed people don\u2019t like feeling shortchanged and still take the pennies even if they only have one or two cents change. Silver Snail Comics on Bank Street has been rounding to the nearest five-cent increment for more than 10 years. The pennies that are collected from the rounding are donated to CHEO. In 2012, the shop donated $1,400. In total, Silver Snail Comics has raised just over $11,000 and plans to continue donating.Heather MacDonald, an employee at Silver Snail Comics, says \u201cnobody cared\u201d about the transition to rounding their purchases. MacDonald says only two people have complained because they wanted their money, so the store gave them a nickel. Johnney Zyadeh, owner of JJ\u2019s Market, says he rounds purchases all the time because he doesn\u2019t like counting pennies. He says stopping the distribution of the penny doesn\u2019t matter to him. Most customers pay by debit, but many still use cash, Zyadeh says. If a customer complains about the rounding, he says he always gives them a nickel.Compact Music on Bank Street has also been rounding purchases for years, says employee Bruce McEwen. He says the business has pennies just in case a customer wants them in their change, but most customers don\u2019t.McEwen says the store doesn\u2019t even count the pennies it has and it\u2019s not a problem to balance the till. McEwen says he doesn\u2019t want to see the unwanted pennies go to waste. He says he has seen art made from them including sculptures and even flooring.The government recommends charities take part in fundraisers to collect unwanted pennies or that Canadians donate their accumulated pennies to charity.The rounding only affects cash purchases and the penny will remain legal tender indefinitely.Businesses may also still price their goods in one-cent increments and there is no obligation to reprogram cash registers.",

The government says it expects businesses to round purchases to the nearest five-cent increment, following the lead of countries such as Australia and New Zealand.Harmony Hawthorn, an employee at Planet Botanix on Bank Street, says rounding to the nearest five cents will take some getting used to. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re all comfortable with the idea yet, just because it\u2019s a strange concept to us all but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get used to it,\"he says. \u201cMy whole lifetime I\u2019ve had the penny, so rounding to the nearest five is going to be a very strange.\u201d Tom Gamble, owner of The Turning Point on Cooper Street, says the penny is a nuisance.However he says he\u2019s noticed people don\u2019t like feeling shortchanged and still take the pennies even if they only have one or two cents change. Silver Snail Comics on Bank Street has been rounding to the nearest five-cent increment for more than 10 years. The pennies that are collected from the rounding are donated to CHEO. In 2012, the shop donated $1,400. In total, Silver Snail Comics has raised just over $11,000 and plans to continue donating.Heather MacDonald, an employee at Silver Snail Comics, says \u201cnobody cared\u201d about the transition to rounding their purchases. MacDonald says only two people have complained because they wanted their money, so the store gave them a nickel. Johnney Zyadeh, owner of JJ\u2019s Market, says he rounds purchases all the time because he doesn\u2019t like counting pennies. He says stopping the distribution of the penny doesn\u2019t matter to him. Most customers pay by debit, but many still use cash, Zyadeh says. If a customer complains about the rounding, he says he always gives them a nickel.Compact Music on Bank Street has also been rounding purchases for years, says employee Bruce McEwen. He says the business has pennies just in case a customer wants them in their change, but most customers don\u2019t.McEwen says the store doesn\u2019t even count the pennies it has and it\u2019s not a problem to balance the till. McEwen says he doesn\u2019t want to see the unwanted pennies go to waste. He says he has seen art made from them including sculptures and even flooring.The government recommends charities take part in fundraisers to collect unwanted pennies or that Canadians donate their accumulated pennies to charity.The rounding only affects cash purchases and the penny will remain legal tender indefinitely.Businesses may also still price their goods in one-cent increments and there is no obligation to reprogram cash registers.",

The Ottawa branch of the Ontario Genealogical Society started Gene-O-Rama in 1981 in order to share knowledge on topics such as military history and the history of immigrant groups in Canada. More and the Ottawa branch had been using the LAC for events and meetings for about three years. He says the branch members are disappointed about the cancellation. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from a few people who are saying they\u2019re going to write to their MP,\u201d he says, adding that he contemplated filing a complaint with the RCMP for what he describes as a \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactic by Public Works officials: quoting one price and then adding subsequent fees and charges on top of that price. In March 2012, More says Event and Conference Management (the branch of PWGSC which handles bookings at the LAC) informed him that the cost of renting three rooms would increase to 25 per cent of the market rate in 2013. However, More says he was not\u00a0\u00a0 told about additional fees at the time. The total cost of using the space needed for Gene-O-Rama, which More was originally told would be $500, soon rose to $2,300. \u201cThey would never tell us anything,\u201d More says about the costs. \u201cI\u2019d hear a rumour from somebody or from another group.\u201dWhen he emailed the management branch asking if what he\u2019d heard was true, More says it was only then that he was informed of possible further charges. These included a $125 fee for wireless Internet, cancellation of the half-day rate he had previously been quoted, a $500 fee to use the auditorium\u2019s projector and equipment rental fees, despite the fact that Gene-O-Rama\u2019s own audio-visual equipment was compatible with that supplied by PWGSC and had been used in the past, More says. LAC officials told Centretown News in September 2011 that PWGSC would be taking over control of the building\u2019s public spaces in January 2012. Groups would also have to receive approval from the relevant government department before hosting an event at the facility. Public Works spokeswoman Annie Duguay said in an email that the federal government implemented the new charging arrangements at the library according to existing policy on property management to \u201crecover for rental of space at a market based rate\u201d and to recover the costs of goods and services supplied to NGOs and community groups using the space. Rent was then waived until January 2013 after groups such the Free Thinking Film Society complained. Public Works would not introduce any new fees until 2013 to allow groups time to \u201cadapt,\u201d Michelle Bakos, a spokeswoman for the department\u2019s minister, Rona Ambrose, told Centretown News in 2011. However, More says service charges and other fees prevented him from continuing to hold monthly meetings at the LAC even before rent was charged. Now, other groups may be forced out too, says Gabrielle Charbonneau, community outreach manager at the Council of Heritage Organizations in Ottawa. While she says understands Public Works and the libary have been affected by federal budget cuts, the fees and restrictions imposed by the department can be crippling for NGOs and community groups. Some groups don\u2019t have offices of their own, Charbonneau adds, and depend on facilities like the LAC to hold meetings and events. \u201c(Volunteers) are putting all their time and energy towards organizing these events, so it\u2019s disappointing to find that it\u2019s no longer affordable to hold a small event for the community.\u201d \u00a0Charbonneau says her focus at the Council of Heritage Organizations has turned to providing and locating affordable space for the groups it represents. For More and Gene-O-Rama, that space is the City of Ottawa Archives on Tallwood Drive. The Ottawa branch has relocated there and will use the building to host a smaller-scale event in place of Gene-O-Rama on May 4. The city archives building is not open in the evenings, forcing More to re-schedule meetings to Saturday afternoons, and while the space is sufficient for monthly meetings, it cannot accommodate larger groups or events, he says.

    "body": "Plans to create a more \"liveable\" Ottawa will include solutions proposed by community members and developers to deal with problems that have arisen as the city considers its official plan and transportation and infrastructure blueprints.\r\rThe city unveiled its proposals to deal with 12 key planning issues that will affect future growth in the city, including more guidelines for community design plans and height restrictions for tall buildings, at the Building a Liveable Ottawa 2031 open house last month.The proposals will shape Ottawa's development for the next 18 years.Peter Hume, Alta Vista councillor and chair of the planning committee, said during the presentation that the proposals are \u201cmuch more pragmatic, more prescriptive, less for interpretation and less for mothering.\u201dThe proposals for the official plan are aimed at streamlining the city\u2019s planning and zoning guidelines and may lead to changes in the zoning bylaws. \u201cIt will be a comprehensive implementation to avoid spot-zoning,\u201d Hume said.Some of the proposals introduced to improve urban design and compatibility with neighbourhoods are new requirements for community design plans to identify locations for intensification, areas for mixed-use development, set building height guidelines, and create supports for transit, cycling, and pedestrian use. Community design plans set guidelines for the development and growth of the community and are created in collaboration with community members.Kalle Hakala, one of the city planners on hand to answer questions at the open house, said the community design plans would be the guiding principle when development applications and planning proposals go before council.Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, said he is anxious to see whether the city has taken any of the association\u2019s advice or comments from the Centretown community development plan into consideration when it presents the new proposals.The final version of the Centretown community development plan has been delayed until March, when it will be presented to the planning committee and city council for approval.\u201cHopefully a liveable Ottawa will address how we\u2019re going to develop green space, not only in Centretown but in other areas of the city as well,\u201d Dekker said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the areas of the CDP we were disappointed in. There\u2019s not a great deal of addition of green space and no direction as to how they are going to look at increasing the amount of green space.\u201dThe city\u2019s environment policy was not included in the review, but creating green space may be addressed elsewhere.\u201cFor intensification, looking at the design of those buildings, it might mean creating green space nearby,\u201d Hakala said.The proposals also included new design priority areas, which are potential or established areas of intensification that would have higher standards for design review. The design requirements and review process will be outlined in the draft of the official plan.Bruce Finlay, a senior planner for the city, said in his presentation that this process will simplify the design policies and make them easier to understand.New categories for high-rise buildings were also introduced in the proposals for buildings 10 storeys or more. Buildings 10 to 19 storeys high will be allowed in certain designated areas or where permitted by a community design plan. Buildings that are 20 storeys or more may only be built if a community design plan allows for it.Finlay said the proposals will give a better direction to community design plans and where tall buildings should be located. \u201cThe intention is to put a cap on building heights.\u201d",

    "body": "Some Sparks Street businesses are apprehensive that a new City of Ottawa study could result in a decrease in shopper parking if its proposals are implemented, says Les Gagne, executive director of the street\u2019s BIA.\r\rThe city revealed the results of the Downtown Moves study at an open house on Jan. 17. The study proposes major changes to the downtown core made in conjunction with the arrival of Confederation Line light rail in 2018.The area is already facing a parking deficit and with the looming prospect of losing even more spaces some businesses are concerned, says Gagne.\u201cYou\u2019re strangling Sparks Street and the business community by preventing people from finding easy parking spaces,\u201d Gagne says. \u201cHow is Sparks Street going to survive when we have the strategy of taking away more and more parking spaces in place?\u201dMany of the open air mall\u2019s customers view shopping as a destination and prefer to drive, relying on nearby parking for up to three hours, Gagne says. \u201cThe reality is if you don\u2019t make it inviting enough for customers, they won\u2019t come down.\u201d The Downtown Moves study intends to minimize its impact on parking and maintain current spaces because of their value to businesses, says Nelson Edwards, the city planner leading the study. In the study parking lanes are converted into wider sidewalks during busy periods called \u201cswing spaces\u201d so they can be preserved.Parking will always be a concern, he adds, but changes need to be made, especially with the arrival of LRT. \u201cWe\u2019re working really hard to integrate (proposals) with the Confederation Line so as to avoid people popping out of the ground onto an old, grubby sidewalk that\u2019s barely wide enough to handle thousands upon thousands of people,\u201d Edwards says. The numbers of transit users and cyclists are quickly rising and Edwards says this adds to the necessity of balancing the needs of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. The Downtown Moves team is open to adapting to the public\u2019s concerns, he says.After hearing constructive comments at the open house it is already modifying elements of the study such as clarifying the document\u2019s confusing language, before it goes to transportation committee in March. Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, says he thinks the city could do a better job finding more parking spaces.Both Dekker and Gagne agree the city should complete a study on the availability of downtown parking. There seems to be a discrepancy between the number of required spaces for developments and the actual number of spaces. Dekker says. ",

    "body": "While most people don\u2019t make plans weeks or months in advance, the city must take on the daunting task of planning for an entirely new generation with the Building a Liveable Ottawa 2031 project.\r\rThe idea of planning 20 years in advance has its merits, most notably giving the city time to consult the public on what they want for the future of Ottawa. However, the people making the decisions today may not be the ones who will oversee the end results. In 20 years, it will be today's young people who will make up the majority of the workforce. They will be the ones knocking on the city\u2019s door for better roads and infrastructure, better public transportation and better social programs. The task of\u00a0 keeping skilled young people in Ottawa in the future can be helped by getting them involved in the planning process today. Part of the hype surrounding the Liveable Ottawa plan is that the city is seeking feedback from the public. Last week, the city hosted an information open house; it has also launched an online survey asking residents for their opinions. Getting residents online to participate in the project seems to be the focus for those promoting the Liveable Ottawa plan. However, their strategy will run amiss if the city is not prepared for the online response.While the information open house was well attended, the online feedback will be what draws in the majority of residents, especially youth, who may not have the chance to attend an open house or feel comfortable getting involved in city politics.The survey, available on the city\u2019s website, should only be the first step. While it will give the city data on bike lanes and public transit, there is no room for suggestions and creative ideas.As well, these surveys will not be reviewed until the summer. Going online means that people can get immediate responses and have real-time conversations. Scheduling online live chats with planners and councillors would give people the opportunity to ask questions and help them to better understand the project. If the city is looking to get a response from residents, it should become more involved with social media, such as interacting through community association Facebook groups and be aware of what people are saying on Twitter. With hashtags such as #LiveableOttawa, it makes it simple to see what people are discussing and posting. Even at this early stage of planning, people are already giving feedback through blogs posts and comments. For example, Twitter user @katychancey shares a blog post discussing the Liveable Ottawa project and ends the post with an anxious plea: \u201cI hope #ottcity is listening!\u201d People shouldn\u2019t have to search for ways to make their opinions heard. The city should work to promote and observe the discussions that are taking place. Let\u2019s hope it is already listening. ",

Some families of nine live in apartments for two because that\u2019s all they can afford. Our housing needs are not being met and the instability this causes in people\u2019s lives has a tremendous economic cost \u2013 you can\u2019t prepare your resume on a street corner. Nor is it cheap for taxpayers: the costs of medical care, shelters and day programs for the homeless are more expensive than providing them a place to live.Yet instead of putting resources in to fix the problem, the federal government is actually pulling back support. Over the next 10 years, federally funded mortgages are coming due for housing co-operatives that provide affordable housing.\u00a0Tied to those mortgages are operating agreements that provide vital funding for the co-ops and there are no plans to renew these subsidies. Without them, more than 200,000 of the most vulnerable Canadians could lose their homes.The Conservatives are quietly booking $1.6 billion in annual \u201csavings\u201d from this cut to affordable housing and have no plans to reinvest the money.And that\u2019s not the end of it: the federal Investment in Affordable Housing Program expires in 2014, but the Conservatives have still not begun negotiation for its renewal. It could get rolled into a general infrastructure fund, moving this money out of housing.Why is this happening? Because the Conservatives believe housing is a provincial responsibility and want to get out of it \u2013they even said so in the 2006 Budget.That\u2019s just wrong. The Liberal party believes that the opportunity to succeed begins with a roof over your head. By investing in affordable housing, the federal government could help put some of the most at-risk Canadians back on their feet, living healthy lives and contributing to the economy.

    "body": "Earlier this month, Coca-Cola released a two-minute advertisement called \u201cComing Together.\u201d \r\rThe ad is lively, optimistic, and hopeful while it outlines how Coca-Cola can play a role in helping beat obesity. While we watch images of families, school children, Coca-Cola products, and happy Coke employees, the spot\u2019s voice-over tells us how Coke has lowered its calories per serving by 22 per cent over the last 15 years. \u00a0She also cheerfully announces their plan to introduce \u201csmaller, portion-controlled sizes for (their) most popular drinks\u201d across the U.S by the end of 2013.This is the first time Coke is taking note of the fact that many of its products are contributors to obesity. \u201cThe long term health of our families, and the country is at stake,\u201d the ad proclaims. While it\u2019s a nice step in health education and brand promotion, much larger steps are necessary to battle one of the biggest epidemics facing North America today.According to Statistics Canada, almost a third of Canadians between the ages of five - 17 were overweight in September 2012, compared with 15 per cent in 1978. Statistics Canada predicts by 2040 up to 70 per cent of these children, by then adults, will be overweight.Last September, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg introduced a ban on the sale of sugary beverages, such as Coke, larger than 0.47 litres (16 oz.) at restaurants, movie theatres and stadiums. The ban could come in to effect as early as next month. This is reminiscent of public smoking bans, which became popular in North America in the 1990s and 2000s (smoking in public places and workplaces was banned in Ontario in 2006). Smoking restrictions were a huge factor in decreasing the number of smokers in North America because it marginalized the activity. Bloomberg\u2019s beverage restrictions could do the same to large-sized drinks.From a marketing perspective, statements such as the one Coke makes in its new ad is a step in the right direction. Michael Mulvey, professor of marketing at University of Ottawa, says it is no surprise that Coke is leading the way in this type of advertising. \u201c(Coca-Cola) understands its consumers better than most companies ever will,\u201d says Mulvey. \u201cPart of their culture is listening \u2013 they are listening to what customers say. They see what\u2019s on the radar; they know what people\u2019s concerns are.\u201dThe obesity epidemic goes far beyond soft drinks and Coke products. People have been drinking Coca-Cola since the 19th century. But the impact and contribution to obesity of outrageous serving sizes now being used to distribute Coke and other similar products cannot be ignored.In 1955, McDonald\u2019s started selling Coke as a fountain drink in a 0.2 litre (seven oz.) cup. Today, the typical soda can is 0.35 litres (12 oz.). In the 1980s, 7-Eleven began its Big Gulp campaign and started offering a 0.95 litre (32 oz.), 1.4 litre (48 oz.), 1.89 litre (64 oz.), and even a 3.78 litre (128 oz.) cup size. Today, the standard soft drink cup size at McDonald\u2019s is 0.62 litres (21 oz.).The fast food or beverage industry can\u2019t be blamed solely for North America\u2019s obesity problem \u2013 but it isn\u2019t helping. \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy Coke because they think it\u2019s healthy,\u201d says Mulvey. \u201cPeople buy Coke because they think it\u2019s refreshing and it complements the taste of food \u2013 it\u2019s a hedonic, pleasurable experience. Like most things, in moderation, that\u2019s not a bad thing to have. Where it becomes problematic is where people are feeding themselves in an intravenous sort of way.\u201dThe fact that Coke is making efforts to help people moderate their intake of carbonated beverages is a good thing. More moves like Bloomberg\u2019s in New York need to follow.While some will argue against government regulation on what we should and shouldn\u2019t eat, the problem has grown to the point that it is time for them to take charge.Carleton University social marketing professor David Hubka says there may be less adverse reaction to government intervention than one would expect.\u201cI think industries look to government to regulate them,\u201d says Hubka. \u201cA specific company like Coca-Cola may want to start moving into progressive types |of advertising \"Perhaps in 10, 15 or 20 years, we will start talking about fast food the way we now talk about tobacco. Cigarette advertisements from the 1960s can be shocking to watch. It can be hard to believe that at one time cigarettes were promoted with such disregard (and perhaps lack of knowledge) for the problems they cause. Perhaps years from now the next generation will be watching and laughing at today\u2019s fast food advertisements the way we giggle at bygone cigarette ads.This social transformation must occur. The obesity epidemic is worse than the smoking epidemic for one reason: its biggest victims are children. Childhood obesity is rampant, which ensures that this problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon \u2013 unless we take notes from Coca-Cola: drink lower-calorie drinks, consume smaller portions, and stay physically active. And of course, the one piece of advice they don\u2019t \u2013 and won\u2019t \u2013 give: drink it less often.We don\u2019t allow our children to be exposed to movies with coarse language or nudity; we constantly shield youngsters from sexuality, violence, drugs and alcohol. Yet we allow them to consume fast food and carbonated beverages.The industry needs to change, and so do we \u2013 fast.",

    "body": "Security organizations are challenged with figuring out the best way to keep people safe when they travel. Often, the methods employed are considered an invasion of privacy. \r\rThis is the case with the so-called \u201cnaked\u201d full body scanners in airports. These scanners produce a three-dimensional outline of a person\u2019s naked body. The American Transportation Security Administration will be removing the scanners by June. The Canadian Air Transport Security Authority said in January that it is considering removing the scanners from Canada, but has set no timeline. The scanners only came to Canada in 2009 and only certain passengers singled out before a flight have to go through them. In Canada, passengers asked to go through the scanner can opt instead for a physical search.Regardless of the effectiveness of these machines, the issue is that they are being removed solely for privacy reasons, according to the TSA. While people do have a right to privacy, flying is a privilege and privacy has to be compromised for national security. Fourth-year Manhattanville College student Jessica Kehoe travels back and forth between her school in New York and her home in Ottawa and she says she is comfortable with the precautions in airports, including the full-body scanners \u2014 devices she's walked through many times when leaving the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an invasion of privacy because the images are for the enhanced safety of the other passengers, pilots and flight attendants,\u201d she says. \u201cI honestly feel safer when I see the body scanners because it\u2019s just an extra measure that can be used so 9/11 tragedies don\u2019t happen again.\u201dIt is important to protect people when they fly. Once on the plane, emergency procedures to protect people become difficult to implement if someone is able to smuggle something dangerous inside. Kehoe says security officers give the option between a physical search or the body scanner machine.\u201cIn all the times I have flown, I have never seen someone deny or put up a fuss over the body scanner,\u201d says Kehoe. \u201cI feel that people who fly understand the risks and obviously from past events know how important safety is, not only to themselves, but to others.\u201dAir travel, because of the requisite safety precautions, can be a hassle and some people may find the rules and safety methods overly cautious. But if security protocols begin relaxing safety measures in the interest of privacy or comfort, the risk of an emergency increases. The security measures are meant to protect people, not simply hassle them or make them feel uncomfortable. People who fly will have to understand that the practices are not there without reason and should not be removed unless they are causing more harm than benefits.",

Defining Moments: Discovering Our Canadian Stories features work by 26 young people aged 13 to 30 from all across Canada and focuses on themes of national identity.The exhibition will be part of Winterlude\u2019s WinterBlast Youth Weeekend, which will feature events for teens and young adults. It is on display at Confederation Park in downtown Ottawa and 12 of the 26 finalists will be in the capital for the last weekend of Winterlude to showcase their work. Marmont, 25, won first place with \u201cWheatfield,\u201d a landscape painting of a wheat field in Alberta. Marmont, who moved to Canada from New Zealand when she was 13, says she was struck by Alberta\u2019s landscape from a young age. She says her childhood experiences with Western Canadian landscapes eventually influenced her art.Marmont says her first encounter with Canada was in Western Canada and influenced her family\u2019s decision to move permanently to Canada in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s so wide open and expansive and when I saw that landscape when I was a young kid it had a huge impact on me,\u201d she says.Second-place winner Luckhurst-Cartier, 26, says he wanted to deal with ideas of relation and identity. He created a diptych, \u201cWhapmagoostui,\u201d entirely from descriptions over the phone from a friend living in the Whapmagoostui First Nations community in northern Quebec. \u201cI was dealing with themes of territory, vast images of landscapes but also abstract landscapes,\u201d he says. \u201cI used someone else to explain to me the territory without going there, so the image reflects territories that I haven\u2019t seen. It\u2019s the misunderstanding of community.\u201dCorreia, 18, won fourth place with her photograph, \u201cI Love Our Potential.\u201d She says she is a member of Taking It Global and saw the competition as an opportunity to share her art and the concepts behind it. \u201cI thought it was a really great premise of defining your own significant moment in your life,\u201d Correia says. She submitted a photograph of her brother standing silhouetted against a window with his hands in front of his face. She says the emphasis on his hands is supposed to inspire young people to take what they\u2019re good at and apply it to volunteering or to global or social issues that interest them.\u201cMy photograph represents how we have so much potential to do so much and we just have to look around and see it,\u201d Correia says. Marmont, Luckhurst-Cartier and Correia will all have the opportunity to travel to Ottawa with the Defining Moments exhibit and show their work. The National Capital Commission will not only pay for their trip, but will also provide them with digital cameras to record their stay. They all agree young people should take more of an interest in the arts and that the importance of art is getting lost among Canadian youth.Marmont cites technology as a reason children may not have as much interest in art as their elders do.\u201cWhen I was a young kid I really didn\u2019t have many toys and a lot of us can relate to just not having as much as the young generation now has,\u201d Marmont says. \u201cYou would naturally gravitate towards creating your own imaginary world\u2026you would actively be creating that rather than just engaging in it by turning on a power button.\u201dCorreia says schools should be responsible for exposing students to the arts.\u201cScience is so emphasized in school that people are socialized, in a way, not to be involved with (art),\u201d she says. \u201cI think that a lot of people don\u2019t see their own potential in art or haven\u2019t found the type of art they want to explore more.\u201dLuckhurst-Cartier, who works with children at an art museum, says they are actually quite interested in art when it\u2019s explained to them.\u201cI think what\u2019s sad is that they don\u2019t have access to a day school enough,\u201d he says, adding that their lack of interest is misunderstood. One thing is certain \u2013 all three finalists say they\u2019re looking forward to coming to Ottawa to talk with the public about their winning art pieces.\u201cIt blows my mind!\u201d Corriea says excitedly about being chosen as one of the top finalists. \u201cThis is happening. It\u2019s really crazy. I\u2019ve never been to Ottawa.\u201d \u201cThe fun thing is we can talk to the public about it and do some mediation about the work,\u201d Luckhurst-Cartier says.\u201cI\u2019m excited to see how people respond (to my piece) and what they take from it,\u201d says first place winner Marmont. \u201cYou only really know how successful your work is once you hear people talking about it.\u201d",

    "body": "While many Ottawans enjoy this year\u2019s Winterlude festival and the host of artistic displays it includes, it\u2019s easy to forget that the arts can play a role beyond entertainment and esthetic pleasure. Sure, ice sculptures are fun, but a look indoors this week reveals another facet of the art world \u2013 one that is considerably more important.\r\rThe Art of Zhen Shan Ren exhibit will be wrapping up at the St. Brigid\u2019s Centre for the Arts this Sunday, following a five-day stay that was just one of its many stops on a worldwide circuit. The show has been displayed in 50 different countries to date, telling a story that\u2019s relevant far beyond China, the nation that inspired the collection.Each of the paintings occupying the gallery\u2019s walls depicts elements of Falun Gong, a spiritual discipline that emerged in China in the early '90s, characterized by its moral teachings and meditation. Despite (and most likely because of) its widespread popularity, Falun Gong\u2019s practitioners have since been targeted by the country\u2019s government and have been the victims of various human rights abuses. Their struggles and beliefs lie at the heart of the exhibit.At its most basic level, The Art of Zhen Shan Ren offers viewers across the globe an opportunity to gain insight into the struggles and persecution of an under-represented group, but its significance runs far deeper than that. It\u2019s also a stark reminder of art\u2019s unique power to convey truth and elicit empathy across cultures, something as relevant in a democracy like Canada's as it is in China\u2019s oppressive state. While exposure to exhibits and issues from other social contexts is undoubtedly essential in broadening our global understanding, it can be all too easy to fall into a mindset that sees civil crises as something unique to the countries of others, and to overlook those that occur at home. That isn\u2019t to say that activism has had no place in Canada\u2019s artistic tradition \u2013 far from it. You don\u2019t need to delve too far into the vaults to remember the waves made by politicized artists during the 2008 federal election, when Conservative cuts to the arts were widely debated during campaigning. But there are myriad examples of artists across the country, creating socially aware and acutely critical works with the potential, given the right exposure, to stimulate meaningful dialogue. What they produce is more than a reactive rallying cry against immediate threats to their own livelihoods. Individuals and collectives address everything from economic trials, as is the case with Windsor\u2019s Broken City Lab, to the systemic abuse and marginalization of Aboriginal women in Canada, represented in startling works created by Rebecca Bellmore, before her frustrated resignation from the public stage.Today, there are still plenty of current public issues to make citizens (artistic and otherwise) bristle. Recent Idle No More demonstrations come to mind, but the motivations that have underpinned that movement are by no means the only causes for discontent in this country. With a little searching, it\u2019s easy to find people who are expressing that sentiment through various media. Art, when the need arises, can be a formidable weapon to combat both complacency and cynicism \u2013 and one that Canadian artists have as much reason to wield as anyone else. ",

Improvisation takes trust, good communication, creativity \u2013 and 15 seconds. \r\rLisgar Collegiate\u2019s improv team combined those elements to win the regional tournament of the Canadian Improv Games on Jan. 19. Lisgar and 31 other teams from schools in the Ottawa area took to the National Arts Centre stage, where they were given a suggestion from the audience and 15 seconds to create a compelling and creative four-minute performance in this high-energy event. \u00a0\u201cWhat other venue lets 40 high school kids a night, actually say and do whatever they want on stage? That type of freedom in front of an audience is extremely rare,\u201d says Al Connors, president and artistic director of the regional and national Canadian Improv Games.Over the course of four nights, five teams of eight improv players competed in four events in an elimination contest leading to the Jan. 19 final. \u00a0Lisgar\u2019s team finished with the highest score, securing its place in the nationals along with Glebe and Canterbury high schools.Lisgar\u2019s improv team has competed in the nationals almost every year since 2004, but has not won the national title since 2000.Connors, who has directed the games for 12 years, says a good improv team takes commitment, communication and practice \u2013 which he admits is sometimes hard for high school students.Lisgar\u2019s improv team has no trouble with commitment. During the year, the team members practise three or four times a week. Team member Lexa Michaelides says the team eats lunch together and makes plans outside of school, such as bowling, as team-bonding activities. This year, the team faced a new challenge \u2013 the teacher\u2019s labour dispute \u2013 which kept the coach who started the team in 1996, Kathleen Klassen, from\u00a0 extracurricular activities.\u201cWe\u2019re getting by, but it sucks. It\u2019s difficult not having her there,\u201d says Adrian Manicom, another member of Lisgar\u2019s improv team. He says a coach helps when they are stuck on a problem, if they can\u2019t agree on an idea and generally just to guide and teach them.In the meantime, Eric Stewart, who graduated last year and was part of the improv team when he attended Lisgar, volunteers as a coach. Stewart is a first-year university student though, and not always able to come to practices, so the team also relies on parent volunteers for help.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s tough. We generally need a grounded person who keeps us on track,\u201d says Michaelides, who has stepped up as a team captain. She says team members are all equals, though she has taken on some administrative roles, such as organizing fundraisers and practices.Connors says that having a coach or some sort of leader outside of the team is important for a strong improv unit. A coach can \u201cact as an outside eye to help kind of shape the team,\u201d he says, \u201cand remind them about what they are supposed to be doing and to push them to practise, because practicing is not something that is always a fun thing to do.\u201dThe labour dispute has not only affected Lisgar\u2019s team; cities such as Sudbury and Kingston, which also have regional competitions, have seen a drop of almost half in school participants, Connors says. Ottawa\u2019s regional tournament avoided this by introducing junior teams and allowing schools to enter more than one team.Connors says games \u201care more like a sporting event than anything. It\u2019s cheering for teams \u2013 we\u2019re the only group, I\u2019m pretty sure, that ever gets noise complaints at the National Arts Centre \u2013 it gets loud, it gets sweaty, it\u2019s really high energy.\u201dLisgar improv students say they love the high energy and positive attitude. Michaelides says the team\u2019s coach would tell them, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you do. Have a great 16 minutes and hopefully you\u2019ll get another 16 minutes.\u201dThe Canadian Improv Games National Festival will take place over the last week of March at the National Arts Centre, with the top five teams competing for the 2013 title on March 30.

    "body": "Ottawa art lovers will have a chance to toast some of the city\u2019s most promising talents next week. The Council for the Arts in Ottawa (CAO) gets set to host its annual Cocktail for the Arts on Feb. 12. The event will feature the announcement of various Ottawa-based artists\u2019 awards that focus on artistic achievements in a city not often lauded for welcoming creative ingenuity.\r\rAmong several prizes up for grabs is the high profile Mid-Career Artist award. This year will mark the eighth time that the title has been awarded. The prize is meant to encourage successful artists residing in Ottawa to stay in Ottawa, says CAO executive director, Peter Honeywell.Honeywell says that in Ottawa, the spotlight tends to be on emerging artists who pique the attention of the arts community, but that period of interest is often shortlived.\u201cIf they continue their career, they hit a plateau of artistic development and often they\u2019re not encouraged,\u201d Honeywell says, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen for a number of years that when people reach that level, they sometimes look at other cities and other opportunities.\u201dHoneywell says the COA doesn\u2019t want talented or career artists to consider Ottawa a jumping off point to larger, more arts-oriented cities like Toronto or Montreal.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to recognize them here at the local level and to encourage them to stay here and continue to work in the arts,\u201d he says.And according to the COA, there\u2019s a market for awards like this in Ottawa. Stars of the performing, visual and media arts have claimed the prize of $5,000 in the past. Generally speaking, Honeywell says the winner is usually an established artist with an innovative approach and a sustained practice. They are also usually professionals with a lot to offer to the city\u2019s arts scene.Cindy Stelmackowich, an Ottawa-based artist, curator and professor whose work focuses primarily on themes of medicine and anatomical science, was the 2009 recipient of the award. Stelmackowich says it\u2019s becoming easier and easier to participate in art projects across Canada while still remaining stationed in one city, for that reason she\u2019s never been very tempted to leave Ottawa.\u201cCurators and galleries can \u2026 correspond quite effectively from far distances these days, making living in a smaller city possible to engage with the larger contemporary art community.\u201dFor Stelmackowich, this award was the exact kind of acknowledgement she needed from the Ottawa arts community in 2009.\u201cIt gave me the confidence to pursue new artistic projects that built on what I had been experimenting with.\u201dFor Honeywell and the COA, awards like this are crucial for both celebrating and sustaining a thriving arts community in the city. Initially, a panel of three judges will select three finalists to be revealed at their February arts affair. The finalist and eighth winner of the award will be revealed at a sit down dinner event at the end of April. ",

    "body": "A recent\u00a0 fact-finding trip to Europe\u00a0 by members of the Somerset West Community Health\u00a0 Centre has inspired new discussions among community organizers about safe injection sites in Ottawa.\r\rTwo board members and an employee from the centre visited four cities in Germany and the Netherlands last fall to research supervised safe injection sites, says the centre\u2019s executive director, Jack McCarthy. The centre paid for the trip using leftover reserve money from donors. None of the funds came from major funders such as the city or from the Champlain Local Health Integration Network.Supervised injection sites allow users to take illicit drugs under the care of health professionals. In September 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Insite, a supervised injection site in Vancouver, could continue to operate legally. While the health centre has learned a lot from Insite, McCarthy says they wanted a broader portrayal of supervised injection sites.While the staff took the trip to gather information, McCarthy says, the centre does not have an official stance on the sites.\u201cWe were specifically looking at safe consumption sites as one strategy in a range of harm reduction programs,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we really focused on. How did they work, and how was the community engaged before they were set up?\u201dThe employees found that the sites in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht, in the Netherlands, and Frankfurt, Germany, moved drug users out of public spaces and into medical facilities. These cities saw crime rates and disease transmission decrease. Public support for the sites increased over time, McCarthy says. McCarthy says the health centre hopes to promote discussion about sites in Ottawa.\u00a0\u201cEveryone wants to live in a safe community, for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then how do we reach out to (drug users), often with mental health and addiction issues, and create the right kind of approaches that minimize the harm to the community and minimized the harm to them and to others, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to do here.\u201dThe Centretown Community Health Centre is also gathering information on supervised injection sites, says executive director Simone Thibault. With high intravenous transmission rates of HIV and Hepatitis C among drug users, she says the community must be more involved in these talks.\u201cWe all need to be better informed and educated,\u201d she says. Despite these centre\u2019s efforts to promote discussion for supervised injection sites, there is still staunch opposition to them from city officials and community organizers. The Ottawa Police Service is \u201cdead against\u201d them, says Insp. Chris Rheaume, because they will make it more difficult to arrest drug offenders. Instead, Rheaume says communities should focus on teaching children about drugs in a more effective way.\u201cEvery dollar that we, and I\u2019m going to use the word \u2018waste,\u2019 on a supervised injection site could be a dollar that we could be putting toward educating the public.\u201d ",

    "body": "Veronica Tang, Centretown NewsDevelopers want to get rid of this parking lot at the corner of Somerset and LeBreton streets and build a nine-storey complex to attract more people to Chinatown. A new multi-use development proposal in Chinatown for a space that would include an Asian-oriented grocery store and 75 rental apartments will bring much needed business to an area that is often overlooked by consumers, says Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes.\r\rDeveloper DCR Phoenix has targeted the corner of Somerset and Lebreton streets, an area currently a parking lot, as the location for a proposed nine-storey building. The proposal also includes an Asian restaurant to be built alongside the grocery and apartments. Holmes says the area\u2019s businesses will benefit with the parking lot gone.\u201cFor a retail street like Somerset, it\u2019s very bad for business to have huge empty spaces. This is a very good development for the area,\u201d she says. According to DCR Phoenix\u2019s planning report, the grocery store will encompass 1,175 square metres of the building\u2019s main floor. The proposed space is larger than the Kowloon Market, located a few blocks east on the corner of Somerset and Arthur streets. Holmes sees an opportunity for growth \u2013 instead of greater competition \u2013 and a wider range of service to an area that has been relatively barren of grocery stores since the Booth Street Loeb closed back in 2006.\u201cThe more markets you have in one general area, the more people will come,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd competition comes more from T & T Supermarket in the south end. It draws business away from Chinatown. I think having two markets on the same street will benefit both by attracting more people to the area.\u201d Holmes says there was a similar development plan for the corner in place for the past five years but it fizzled out before any progress could be made. This current proposal, which has made it further than any in the past, is two to three storeys higher than the earlier plans, which could potentially delay and completely derail the process. Because of the added height, DCR Phoenix, who did not return phone calls for a comment, has applied for a re-zoning of the parking lot. The developer is attempting to double the area\u2019s current height restriction from 16 metres to 32 metres, a decision Holmes and city council is only prepared to make once they get a good sense of what the community wants.\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to tell what the community feels about the added height,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cBut it does make the development more viable and I think they\u2019ll see the business advantages. We\u2019ll have to wait and hear from community members though.\u201d Planners at DCR Phoenix think they are just pressing forward with the natural progression of the area. \u201cBeing first to redevelop an underutilized site along this section of Chinatown\u2019s main street, great care has been taken to design the building to enhance the neighbourhood, while maintaining compatibility with its surroundings,\u201d the proposal states. \u201cOver time, it is expected that this section of Somerset will intensify, with greater heights and densities than are seen today.\u201dAlthough city council will hold off their decision for at least a few more months \u2013 a more accurate timeline has yet to be determined \u2013 some members of the community are hoping everything gets approved quickly.\u201cI really hope the building goes up as fast as possible,\u201d says Ken Pei, who lives only a few minutes\u2019 walk from the site. \u201cWe only have one car so sometimes it\u2019s difficult for my wife to get groceries. \"It also means we won\u2019t have to look at that empty parking lot any-more. I think the rest of the community will see this building as a good thing for the area.\u201d",

    "body": "The key to reforming the job market is to re-energize the youth market. A debate held at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, focused on young workers as the solution to reclaiming five years of lost financial ground. \r\rYouth are three times more likely to be unemployed, according to an International Labor Organization report. Meanwhile, an astounding number of mid-level, middle-class jobs have withered away in a cold economic climate.So, how does Ottawa\u2019s business landscape fare with these dour employment levels? New initiatives that bring in business volunteers to schools to mentor students about financial literacy and entrepreneurship are popping up around the city, but these programs are scant and still developing.When labour disputes subside, the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board would be wise to invest in connecting more local companies with potential future employees: those of a high-school age, and even younger.The close ties between teens and upper management could not only motivate students to pursue business at university, but help them dip their feet into the local working environment. As a result, more young people may become involved in shaping the city\u2019s growing business landscape once they graduate, as employees and entrepreneurs.A recent story in the Ottawa Business Journal suggested that students who get business experience at university are more inclined to stick around their alma mater\u2019s city and pursue a career.Many Ottawa high school students head out of town for university, so linking youths with local companies at a younger age can have long-term benefits. If Ottawa businesses can network more closely with students, there may be a greater awareness among youths of the career opportunities available.A few initiatives that connect companies with classrooms in Ottawa are already working. One is the Junior Achievement\u00a0 program, which is available in 123 countries and in 15 cities across Canada.In the JA program, volunteers from local businesses, such as the Royal Bank of Canada and IBM, come in to classrooms. They share their work experiences and mentor students about financial literacy. In Grade 5, students form an assembly line and learn about productivity. In higher grades, students compete in an online business simulation as managers of different tech companies. JA is offered to schools at no charge, with the sponsors picking up the costs. The program, which runs in 25 schools across Ottawa, seeks to register more than 30 new schools before the 2012/2013 session finishes, says Albert Wong, director of Ottawa\u2019s JA program. Another way to ensure more involvement with students in business endeavours is to alter the community service requirement. Currently, students in Ontario must complete 40 hours of community service through four years of high-school. Since changing the provincial 40-hour standard would likely be difficult, individual schools may want to push forward for another requirement: to complete a certain amount of job training or to take part in a co-op placement with a business sometime during four years of high school. Damien Martin, the education and youth services co-ordinator for Volunteer Ottawa, says that his organization often shies away from enlisting with paid businesses. Instead, Volunteer Ottawa helps encourage students to volunteer with non-profit companies and charities. These efforts are noble and important, but there should also be an opportunity to push dedicated students forward to interning or helping out with paying firms during their high-school years. This can give students a feel for the world of local business, while allowing managers the chance to look out for aspiring entrepreneurs who can be valuable to their enterprise in the future.By increasing student involvement with local companies, there are more opportunities for youth to gain work experience that can impress a future employer, commit them to pursuing a city job, and \u2013 perhaps most important \u2013 enhance their education.",

The complex will include space for private sector and non-profit use and is due to be completed in 2016.Invest Ottawa president and CEO Bruce Lazenby says Centretown has been a great home, but it is time to move on.\u201cWe always considered our situation here at 80 Aberdeen (St.) to be an interim solution.\u201dThe organization moved from its west end location to Centretown in December 2011 and opened for business in February 2012. But Lazenby says the organization has expanded too much to stay put.\u00a0\u201cAfter only 10 months of operations we\u2019re full and we\u2019ve got people wanting to move in and we have to say no,\u201d Lazenby says.The Aberdeen location currently houses 36 companies and 100 entrepreneurs. Lazenby says the new space should help Invest Ottawa host twice as many businesses. Entrepreneurs do not currently pay rent at Invest Ottawa, but they are required to enlist in one of the centre\u2019s programs, which cost $300 per person, per month. Lazenby says it's too early to tell but he hopes to continue offering space in the new building for free, with rent offset by program fees.Lori Mellor, executive director of the Preston Street BIA, says having Invest Ottawa in Little Italy helped raise the community\u2019s profile. She says she will be sad to see it leave, but understands the motive behind the move.\u201cIt\u2019s good for all Ottawa business if we have a thriving innovation centre,\u201d she says.Mellor adds that she hopes some of the entrepreneurs in the business accelerator program will choose to stay in the neighbourhood after the move.Kitchissippi Ward Coun. Katherine Hobbs says the city hopes to finish construction on the Bayview Yards innovation complex by the time Invest Ottawa\u2019s current lease is up in 2016.The city has already received $15 million from the province toward the innovation complex and will add $15 million itself in in-kind contributions, such as donating 14,150 square metres of the 67,300 square metre lot.\u201cIt\u2019s an economic boost for Ottawa,\u201d Hobbs says. \u201cIf you can generate jobs and interest people in an area, perhaps this is where they will set up their business. There\u2019s room there to do it, as well.\u201dHobbs says she is thrilled the innovation hub will be developed near Mechanicsville, a more industrial and less densely populated part of Kitchissippi. \u201cOnce you have a critical mass of people where there haven\u2019t been any, you can support the associated services that you need when you have a good, viable mixed-use area,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful for Kitchissippi.\u201dThe location is perfect for a business centre because of the light rail transit station to be developed nearby and the Bayview O-Train station, says Hobbs. Lazenby says the transit is a substantial perk because many of his entrepreneurs do not own cars and will appreciate the easy access to Carleton University and the University of Ottawa.",

The Sens Mile signs were installed above the street signs within days of the decision and will stay until the season is over.Sam Eyamie, owner of The Fox and Feather, says the Sens Mile is a significant part of Ottawa. \u201cOttawa\u2019s the greatest city to be in, unlike other cities like Vancouver or Montreal, (the hockey) is a community event with a lot of atmosphere.\u201d he says. \u201cElgin is where everybody hangs out. It\u2019s mayhem and it\u2019s beautiful and it brings the city together.\u201dKeith Loiselle, owner of Woody\u2019s Pub, agrees that the early addition of the signs to Elgin Street is a great move.\u201cHockey certainly brings a lot of love to the street. Our seats fill up quickly and we have a lot of people squatting, and waiting for the game to start,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it's a step in the right direction, no matter how you look at it.\u201dBrian Karam, owner of MacLaren\u2019s, says many of the owners of the bars and pubs along Elgin Street would like the strip to be known as \u201cThe Sens Mile\u201d or \u201cRed Mile\u201d all year round.\u201cElgin, the Red Mile, is not only the main street of Ottawa, it is the main street of Canada,\u201d he says.Karam says that the sport brings \u201cthousands\u201d of people to Elgin ",

Those are the two options mothers-to-be have in Ottawa. But later this year, a third option will be available when a new midwife-led birth centre opens on Walkley Road.\r\rWhile the third option will be too late for Alexandra Thompson, the 38-year-old soon-to-be mother of two, she welcomes the idea of a birth centre because a midwife provides a continuity of care that isn\u2019t available in hospitals. She gave birth to her two-year-old son at home and is now expecting another child in March \u2013 also expected to be a home birth.\u201cI love working with a midwife. She is there during my pregnancy, through the birth and in the weeks after. It\u2019s a very familiar face guiding you through everything.\u201dThe Ottawa Birth and Wellness Centre was announced on Jan. 24 by Health Minister Deb Matthews as part of the Ontario government\u2019s Action Plan for Health Care.\u201cGiving women in Ottawa more options on where to receive maternity care makes sense. Women can seek the type of care that fits their needs, close to home in their own community,\u201d said Matthews.Ottawa midwife Genevieve Gagnon considers the opening of a birth centre a historical moment.\u201dAll over the province, midwives have been visualizing a birth centre since midwifery became a regulated health profession in 1994. We are very excited.\u201dMidwives provide primary care for women considered to have low-risk pregnancies. They assist the mother in labour, birth and early post-natal care. Aside from providing pregnant women with another option as to where they want to give birth, the government hopes that the birth centre will take some of the burden off hospitals.\u201cHaving a baby is a leading cause for hospitalization of women and many of them don\u2019t really need to be hospitalized,\u201d Matthews said in an interview. \u201cThis new birth centre will provide high-quality care, but also better value for our health dollars by moving routine procedures from hospitals and into a specialized, not-for-profit clinic.\u201dNot wanting to be hospitalized is one of the major reasons why Thompson chose home births for both her first and second child.\u201cI connect hospitals to being sick and I\u2019ve never been to a hospital for an illness or anything, so for me it is a very unfamiliar environment.\u201dMidwives will continue to serve clients who wish to give birth in a hospital, Gagnon says, but believes there are many advantages to giving birth in a birth centre. Women who chose a birth centre will be able to walk around, eat and drink as they please during labour, and choose how they want to give birth, she says.\u201cThey are not limited. A birth centre includes options that you would not typically see in a hospital,\u201d Gagnon says.\" One of the biggest attributes to the birth centre is that they provide big tubs for labour and birth. That\u2019s a big no-no in hospitals, where women have to get out of the water to give birthThe centre will lease space at 226 Walkley Road in the Ottawa Business Park and is expected to open sometime in the summer.According to provincial statistics, about 142,000 babies are born in Ontario every year and up to 22,000 are delivered by midwives. There are about 640 registered midwives in Ontario.",

    "body": "It\u2019s December 1913 and Ottawa police Chief Const. Alex Ross has an important announcement to make \u2013 the Ottawa Carleton Regional Police Service will be hiring its very first policewoman. \r\rFlorence Campbell was a former probation officer and superintendent of the Women\u2019s Hostel. This year marks the 100th anniversary of her landmark appointment. For members of the Ottawa police community, the milestone is significant.Const. Isabelle Coady had heard of Campbell before, but was surprised to learn the exact date when she was hired. \u201c1913 is a long time ago,\u201d says Coady, a detective in the elder abuse department of the Ottawa police. \u201cI think it must have been bizarre for a female to actually be a police officer.\u201d Archival research shows that when Campbell started with the police force she was not issued a uniform or a badge and was not allowed to carry a weapon. Her name did not appear on Ottawa Police roster lists and she was not included in any police force portraits. Still, her story made headlines beyond Ottawa appearing in the Essex Free Press, the Windsor Evening Record and the Newmarket Era. In her role, Campbell dealt primarily with women and children\u2019s issues. She helped settle domestic disputes and investigated allegations of child abuse and neglect in a way similar to that of a social worker. Later, she was placed in charge of the telephone switchboard at the police station at Queen Street and Elgin Street. Campbell was able to make arrests, but rarely did. She stated at the time that she preferred a more preventative approach. \u201cShe does not aim to see how many erring mortals she can bring under the hand of the law, but rather how many tangles she can straighten outside of court,\u201d stated a May 1914 article in the Ottawa Journal about Campbell. Campbell retired from the police service in May 1935. In June, she married Ottawa police inspector Thomas McLaughlin. City archival records show that after 21 years of service, her salary of $1,160 a year was still $415 less than that of the lowest ranking male officer position. She was never promoted.With her resignation, the Ottawa Police service abolished the position of policewoman but pressure from local women\u2019s groups such the Local Council of Women and the St. Andrews Society Women\u2019s Auxiliary lead to the hiring of the city\u2019s second policewoman in 1936, Alice Goyette. Today, female officiers fill a variety of different roles in the organization, including severalhigh-ranking positions.However, they are still in the minority. Currently, the Ottawa Police Service reports 366 working female officers and 1,243 males on their roster. Additionally, the average salary of a female Canadian police officer is still significantly lower than that of their male counterparts. Policewomen earn roughly $60,000 compared to $90,000 for policemen, according to the 2006 census. City Coun. Jan Harder says the Ottawa Police Services Board is in the midst of designing a year-long commemoration of the significance of Campbell and women in policing in general. ",

    "body": "Jason Chen, Centretown NewsCommunity activists are appealing to the Ontario Municipal Board to help protect these honey locust trees on Nepean Street. The Centretown Citizens Community Association is trying to save four thornless honey locust trees during the construction of a new condominium.\r\rClaridge Homes plans to build a 27-storey, 199-unit condominium tower at 96 Nepean St., the location of some of the trees.Last August, the CCCA filed an appeal with the Ontario Municipal Board opposing the city\u2019s decision to construct a building whose size exceeds the tall-building guidelines. One of the appeal\u2019s objectives is to save the honey locust trees. The association is concerned that the construction will have a negative impact on the trees\u2019 health and affect their root system.The trees are about nine metres tall and are 30 years old. According to Bonnie Mabee, chair of the CCCA trees and greenspace committee, the trees still haven\u2019t reached full maturity.The Ottawa homebuilder plans to keep four out of the six trees and replace the trees that are removed after construction.Last August, the city approved a zoning change from three metres to one. This means that buildings can now be constructed only one metre from the sidewalk.Rob Dekker, co-chair of the planning and development for the CCCA, says the current zoning area is too close to the trees. \u201cThere is not enough space to let these trees live and survive during the construction,\u201d says Dekker.The CCCA wants to have the zoning requirements amended to allow three to four meters of space. According to Dekker, this will give sufficient sunlight and space for the trees.\u00a0\u201cWe are very concerned about their protection during construction,\u201d adds Mabee. \u201cThese trees have a shallow, wide spreading of roots that need to be protected.\u201d According to Mabee, the trees need to be protected up to their drip line, the diameter around the tree where water drips down from the outer most branches. \u201cOnce you impact the roots, there may be some concerns about the life of the tree.\u201dDaniel Earns, certified arborist and co-owner of Bowthorpe Tree Services in Ottawa, says the honey locust tree is a good choice for urban areas. If construction were to go ahead, a \u201cdrip line barrier is strongly recommended.\u201d\u201cIf construction were to happen as planned, the roots of the trees could be severed and you will see a dieback directionally on that part of the plant,\u201d says Earns. Increasing the setback would reduce damage to the root systems and provide more water capacity and nutrients for the trees.Mabee says the 96 Nepean St. development is only a small part of a broader issue in Centretown. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re losing what few trees we do have, and these developments limit the potential for new ones, which is a huge concern,\u201d says Mabee. \u201cWe already have the least amount of greenspace in any area in Ottawa.\u201dDekker says the OMB will hear the appeal this month.

Amy Kneebone was 11 years old when her teacher introduced her to goalball, a game for visually impaired athletes.\r\rA decade and two Paralympic Games later, the Canadian national women\u2019s team captain is at the forefront of a wave of talent that has transformed Ottawa into the unofficial epicentre of goalball in the country. \u201cOttawa is the huge hotbed,\u201d says Shane Enau, high performance director for Canadian Blind Sports, the national organization for goalball. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like we said that we were going to start up a training centre in Ottawa, it just seemed to happen that way.\u201dGoalball is a sport exclusive to blind and visually impaired athletes. Played between two teams of three players, the objective of the game is to roll a ball containing a noise bell\u00a0 \u2013 known as the goalball \u2013 in a bowling ball motion into the opponent\u2019s net while the opposing team tries to block it by sprawling on the ground.The game is played on a standard gymnasium volleyball court in total silence \u2013 crowd included \u2013 so that players can hear the goalball. In tournament play, players are also required to wear patches and blacked-out goggles over their eyes to prevent any player with partial site from having an unfair advantage.According to Enau, goalball has more participants than any other Paralympic sport. In the London Games, 72 players suited up for 15 countries in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments. He says there are 90 competitive-level players in Canada alone \u2013 more than the number of athletes in all other Paralympic sports combined. Canada has emerged as one of the most decorated countries since the sport became a full part of the Paralympic Games in 1980.The women\u2019s team has been especially successful throughout the history of the sport. Despite missing the podium in both of the last two Paralympic Games, the team is tied with the United States for first in all-time medal count for the sport. Until recently, most of that success came from a group of elite players based in the Brantford area, where the W. Ross Macdonald School for the blind, visually impaired and deafblind served as the main goalball training centre in the country.Janice Dawson, the women\u2019s national team coach, says that began to change when the school started to shift its mandate in order to include youths with disabilities other than visual impairment about five years ago.With two members of the men\u2019s national team based in Ottawa, when the level of goalball in Brantford began to decline, the capital became an obvious landing ground for those who wanted to continue to improve their game. Kneebone, who is originally from Charlottetown, P.E.I., was one of the first of the elite players to make the move.\u201cIt was a great opportunity for me to get to train with [the members of the men\u2019s team] and have them teach me everything they know,\u201d Kneebone says. She isn\u2019t surprised that others have followed.\u201cPeople have been moving from Brantford once they graduate from the blind school because they know the best place to practice goalball is here in Ottawa,\u201d she says.The pilgrimage of goalball players has been impressive. According to Dawson, four of the six members of the women\u2019s national team now live in Ottawa. Enau says the mass relocation of elite players has also had an effect on people in the lower levels of the sport. He says in the last year, people have moved to the city from as far away as Calgary for training purposes.\u201cIf you\u2019re training to throw a ball, you want to throw against someone who can block the ball really well, and you want to have someone who can throw a ball when you\u2019re working on your defensive skills,\u201d he says.Although it started as a grassroots movement among the country\u2019s elite players, the governing bodies of the sport have embraced the move to the capital.Prior to last year\u2019s Paralympic Games in London, the women\u2019s national team was centralized for three months of training for the first time in its history. According to Dawson, Ottawa was the natural choice to be the host city. \u201cThat was a big step for our program,\u201d she says.Dawson says she hopes to do the same before the next Paralympic Games in Brazil and she doesn\u2019t see a reason why the venue \u2013 or the local Ottawa talent \u2013 will be any different.",

We were all encouraged to write our own inspirational message about beating cancer in yellow chalk beneath them.One that will stick with me and highly poignant considering the recent debacle surrounding Armstrong was \u201cLance Armstrong is my hero.\u201d But I disagree.\u00a0 Athletes shouldn\u2019t be heroes.Many are highly paid and usually skilled at one thing, be it basketball, golf, cycling or any other sport. Given Armstrong\u2019s none-too-stunning admission that he used performance enhancing drugs for his seven Tour de France wins, it\u2019s easy to dismiss his legacy.In the end, I will dismiss his legacy as nothing more than steroids boosting an average man\u2019s career \u2013 with him ruthlessly denying it all the while.By many accounts,\u00a0 Armstrong isn\u2019t a nice man. He\u2019s sued reporters for alleging any wrongdoing on his part and he\u2019s insulted other cyclists and people involved with the sport for doing the same.This is where the \u201chero\u201d tag we give athletes becomes frustrating. Charles Barkley, in an ad for Nike back in 1993, put it best.\u201cI\u2019m not paid to be a role model. Your parents are role models.\u201dBarkley played for 16 years in the NBA and admits he gambles too much and his lifestyle shouldn\u2019t be copied.He vehemently argued throughout his career that just because he could dunk a basketball didn\u2019t make him a role model.Why should we place athletes on a pedestal and declare them to be ideal role models and then become frustrated when they don\u2019t live up to that tag?As Barkley said, what about the regular people in our lives? Doctors, police officers and firefighters all deserve praise.There are hundreds of thousands of people across the world who have survived cancer and deserve recognition.Admittedly, Armstrong has raised millions of dollars for cancer research, but there are other philanthropists throughout the world.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which funds charities around the world, has an endowment of $36.2 billion.Yet, how many people say Bill Gates is their hero?While Armstrong is the most recent to fall from grace, you can cast your gaze back and add Tiger Woods (and various others, from Ben Johnson to Ray Lewis) to that list as well.Woods, a billionaire golfer, was caught having affairs with a string of women and went from golden boy to front-page disaster.Whatever fuels our desire to idolize these men and women, who are skilled at a sport, is wrong.We have idolized athletes far too much for being able to play a sport. It is only a game after all. However, that\u2019s not to say we can\u2019t respect them or compliment them. I respect the athletes that have sacrificed years to become the best in their particular sport. But I don\u2019t hold them up as inspirational people on whom I should base my life. They\u2019re just people.In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Armstrong admitted: \u201cMy ruthless desire to win at all costs served me well on the bike.\u201d That is true. But it hasn\u2019t served him well in the real world and shouldn\u2019t lead us to idolize him.",

Erica Adjei strikes punching bags and watches herself spar in mirrors mounted to the walls of the Beaver Boxing Club to refine her techniques. \r\rShe trains alongside new and experienced boxers, but isn\u2019t like any other fighter in the club.Adjei claimed a second straight Ottawa Sports Award as the city\u2019s best boxer in 2012 on Jan. 30. Her coach says it\u2019s just the first title she can win this year.\u201cI\u2019m looking for Erica to be Canadian champion in 2013,\u201d says three-time Ottawa Sports Award-winner Greg Gayle, who\u2019s coached the 22-year-old for more than two years at Beaver Boxing.\u201cErica can be as good as she wants to be. It\u2019s all up to her and she works very hard in the gym,\u201d he says. \u201cShe wants to, and definitely can, do a lot in boxing.\u201dDespite her loss at the Canadian championships in Membertou, N.S., last January, Ottawa Sports Awards board member Mike Scott says Adjei won the accolade as the city\u2019s best boxer because of her potential to clinch a national title.Adjei won a provincial championship in 2011 and compiled a 6-2 record in 2012 while competing in the 57-kilogram weight class.A fighter with international experience in the 60-kilogram division handed Adjei her second loss of 2012 in November.But fighting against stronger opponents is the only way she can get good enough to win a national championship, says Jill Perry, head coach at Beaver Boxing.\u201cThese are the people she\u2019s going to have to fight,\u201d says Perry. \u201cYou might not win all these kinds of fights, but it\u2019s how you learn the most and grow huge amounts as a boxer.\u201dThe underdog doesn\u2019t always lose, though.Adjei has fewer than 30 fights under her belt, but travelled to Montreal in June and stood toe-to-toe against a Quebec-born boxer who has competed more than 75 times.\u201cThe girl came in a little heavier than what was promised, so Erica was lighter as well as less experienced,\u201d says Perry. \u201cBut Erica beat her soundly. It was a huge, huge upset.\u201dPerry says Adjei is the only boxer in the city who can compete above the provincial level.But Adjei wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to compete, let alone train, if it weren\u2019t for a conversation she says she had with friends in high school.\u201cThere was a bunch of guys interested in starting at Beaver Boxing and I said that we should all join together,\u201d she says. \u201cThey said \u2018you can\u2019t do it. You\u2019re a girl. You\u2019ll quit.\u2019 Almost a month and a half later, I joined the gym and I\u2019ve never seen them there.\u201dAdjei\u2019s now been at Beaver Boxing for more than five years and says she trains four times a week and runs almost every day.A diligent workout schedule will give her a boost when she steps into the ring at the 2013 Ontario Open Championships in Toronto in late-February, she says. In the spring, she\u2019ll have another shot at her first national title.While her jab is one of her best skills, Gayle says Adjei\u2019s confidence and desire to succeed are more impressive.That desire is something that shines through when she speaks.\u201cAnybody can be a champion. It\u2019s about how much work you do in the gym and how much you\u2019re willing to give,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I work and train hard, why can\u2019t I be the Canadian champ?

A project to determine if Ottawa police engage in racial profiling has cleared the public consultation stage.\r\rPolice held round-table discussions last week. About 175 people attended and voiced their concerns about the study and to make recommendations. \u201cThis is an exciting educational opportunity,\u201d said participant Patricia Harewood. Debra Frazer, Ottawa Police Services director general, said the study is an opportunity for better policing. \u201cIs your behaviour motivated by race? Ask yourself (the OPS) that question as an institution,\u201d she asked rhetorically. Participants called for regular public updates about the project and voiced concerns over proposed race categories and how to keep officer bias out of the data. The OPS also hosted a two-hour chat through Twitter Jan. 23 for similar feedback, met with minority community groups and offered an online questionnaire, said Insp. Pat Flanagan, the OPS project lead in an interview \u201c(The goal) is to incorporate all the feedback into the project to ensure we\u2019re designing the best possible product,\u201d he said.Over the next two years, officers will record these perceptions at all traffic stops as part of the Traffic Stop Race Data Collection Project, beginning April 27 \u2013 the largest such study in Canada. The data collected would be compared to information from the Canadian census to determine if statistics reveal possible racial profiling behaviour among officers. The project stems from a settlement between the Ottawa Police Services Board and the Ontario Human Rights Commission calling for more race data collection after a 2005 human rights complaint by an Ottawa man, said Flanagan. A young man driving a luxury car alleged police stopped him because of his race.The OPS is working with a research team at York University that has proposed the methodology for the study, including race categories and what information to collect, said Flanagan. The final details will be fleshed out in the next few weeks after considering public feedback.\u201cThis project is groundbreaking because there\u2019s so much careful attention to data collection,\u201d said Dr. Lesley Jacobs, a member of the research team.The proposal was influenced by studies in the United States and England, as well as smaller Canadian projects, said Dr. Lorne Foster, another team member, in an interview. It suggests data collection be a computerized system in the officer\u2019s vehicle. The officer would see the current OPS race categories, which were used to sporadically collect race data in the past. \u201cThe best way to create the study is not to create it where officers have too much of a change or it becomes too complicated for them to comply,\u201d he said. The categories are, however, outdated, so the team would then convert the OPS categories into their own and compare them to census data. Since the study is about police perception of race rather than how the driver self-identifies, the proposed categories are broader than those in the census, taking into account the difficulty of identifying race by observation. For example, the team\u2019s East Asian/Southeast Asian category covers the census\u2019s Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese and Southeast Asian categories. The data could help form future public policies, said Foster. \u201cA lot of people have opinions but we haven\u2019t had the data in this country to be able to make in informed decisions.\u201dThe OPS plans to release a report in March about the project\u2019s next steps.",

The event will also include games such as beanbag tosses and memory matching, and winter crafts based on the idea of children playing hockey and tobogganing, similar to the image found on the five-dollar bill. Winter-themed art on Canadian currency dates to the 1800s \u2013 one of the earliest examples is from the Hart\u2019s Bank collection, a five-dollar note that depicts a couple riding in a horse-drawn sleigh during the winter.. According to the auction website, icollector.com, this particular note, which does not have a specific year recorded on it, now sells for $215.

I could not believe I was in my own country.\u201dBut just barely. Valberg was standing on a \u201cfloe-edge\u201d \u2013 where, in the small town of Pond Inlet, Nunavut, on the North coast of Baffin Island, the ice ends and the open waters begin.On this cusp of Canadian land she realized how little she knew about the Arctic.Now, having written a children\u2019s book, received photography awards, and founded a charity sending sports equipment to Arctic youth, Valberg says she is thrilled to share her passion with visitors to Winterlude.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to show the North through my eyes,\u201d she says.The photo exhibit, called This is Canada\u2019s Arctic, will be on display at the downtown park until Feb. 18.The Canadian Arctic Expedition, describes David Gray in Northern People, Northern Knowledge, did not have an entirely Canadian beginning.Despite being initiated by Canadian ethnologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, the expedition was originally under the control of the American Museum of Natural History. Not until Prime Minister Robert Borden became aware that new land might be discovered did it come under Canadian authority, through funding. And, as Stefansson\u2019s primary objective was discovering new land, it was only after involvement from the Geological Survey of Canada, who then controlled the Museum of Nature, that the expedition included scientific study. In the end, scientific and territorial interests were satisfied, with the expedition finding Canada three islands, four thousand photographs, nine thousand feet of movie film, and quantities of animal, fossil, and rock specimens. Over one thousand botanical specimens alone were added to the Museum of Nature\u2019s collection.Later this year, some of these 100-year-old plant specimens will escape the museum\u2019s archives to be displayed next to recent samples collected by the museum\u2019s botany team.The exhibit, called Flora of the Canadian Arctic Expedition, will run from April to November.Eight plants from the historical expedition and eight from a 2012 to Soper River on Baffin Island, Nunavut, will have their pictures blown up to five feet tall for display, says DNA lab co-ordinator Roger Bull, who is working on the exhibit.The trip to Soper River marked the first serious scientific exploration of the area since Dewey Soper\u2019s in 1931, says botany research assistant Paul Sokoloff.Both Bull and Sokoloff participated, helping to add 900 specimens to the museum\u2019s herbarium, including, among other rarities, a northern bog orchid never before recorded in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.Sokoloff says that while sovereignty and resources get a lot of attention, there is also a strong research presence in the Arctic. \u201cThe museum has a focus on Arctic research right now because it is a place of immense change, but also immense potential,\u201d he says.Botanists will tag Arctic plants using GPS and record their invasiveness so, in the future, says Sokoloff, researchers can see what has changed.\u201cPeople have gone into herbaria for invasive plants species, and by using the date it was collected they can pinpoint when invasive plants were introduced,\u201d he says.Senior media relations officer Dan Smythe says the museum has 16 researchers, and in areas such as botany, paleontology, zoology, and mineralogy, 10 of those are working on Arctic-based projects.

Citizens for Safe Cycling recently held its annual family winter bike parade to promote winter cycling in Ottawa, following the release of a new survey that shows a 40-per-cent increase in daily bike trips by commuters over the past six years.\r\rMore 50 cyclists took part in the bike parade in late January to encourage residents to keep their bikes out for the winter season.Cyclists, dressed in winter jackets, scarves, and mittens, followed a seven-kilometre route through Centretown that began at city hall.\u201cI bike all year round now and I want other people to see that it\u2019s easy and you can do it too,\u201d says avid cyclist Lana Stewart. \u201cIt\u2019s not crazy, it\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s just winter in Ottawa.\u201dThe 2011 survey, released on Jan. 24, showed an increase in daily biking by 40 per cent since 2005, according to the Origin Destination Survey for the National Capital Region. The number of daily bike trips in Ottawa surged from 29,220 in 2005 to 40,950 in 2011.\u201cImproved cycling infrastructure is what helps increase cyclists in Ottawa,\u201d says CFSC vice-president Alex deVries. \u201cBuild it and more people will come.\u201dOther key results show that full-time workers and students took over more than 78 per cent of all bicycle trips over the 24-hour period. Men make 68 per cent of cycling trips. The proportion of trips made by women, however, increased from 28 per cent in 2005, to 32 per cent in 2011.The segregated bike lanes on Laurier Avenue and other improved cycling infrastructures are some of the reasons for the increase in biking trips, says deVries. \u201cThe city has invested a lot in bike lanes and there are new projects coming up in the future that will make downtown Ottawa more attractive and hopefully attract more cyclists.\u201dStaying healthy and saving money may have also contributed to the increase of cyclists, says CFSC president Hans Moor.\u201cCycling makes common sense,\u201d says Moor. \u201cGasoline hasn\u2019t been cheap for a long time and it\u2019s easier for residents to save money.\u201dMore winter cyclists on the streets can also encourage the city to keep its bike paths cleared of snow, says deVries.While encouraging winter biking can help promote better cycling infrastructures, Moor says this increase can pose safety concerns.Cyclists say avoiding paths with ice or snow can make winter biking safer and more enjoyable. Dressing in warm clothing and always riding with a light and helmet on are also important in keeping with bike safety.",

We\u2019re losing a lot of greenspace to overdevelopment as a lot of old parking lots that could have been used for gardens are being used to build condo towers. There\u2019s also a lot of shade in Centretown. Vegetables don\u2019t like shade, they like lots of sun.\u201dMabee says that establishing a garden in McNabb Park will address these problems.\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that McNabb Park has a lot of space \u2013 especially sunny space that will enable us to plan for a large community garden,\u201d says Mabee.McNabb also has ample access to water. Mabee noted that is \u201ca tricky issue for some gardens because they don\u2019t have enough water.\u201dJust Food, the City of Ottawa, and members of the network collaborated in 2009 to establish the Community Garden Development Fund. The annual $76,000 fund is used to establish new community gardens and to expand and enrich existing gardens within Ottawa.\u201cWe sent our proposed budget a couple of days ago,\u201d says Mabee. \u201cRight now, we are waiting on the City of Ottawa to approve our budget so we can move forward with this year\u2019s plans. Right now, the city is trying to match the amount we need with the annual budget they give us.\u201dThe Centretown Community Health Centre is among the groups that developed Ottawa\u2019s Food for All Project, an initiative established last year that aims to enhance the city\u2019s sustainability and nutritional profile. According to Christina Marchant, the centre\u2019s director of community health promotion, the community gardens in Ottawa are a key component of this plan.\u201cThe Community Health Centre supports the community gardens in Centretown,\u201d says Marchant. \u201cCommunity gardens provide health benefits including increased access to affordable healthy food, they teach people about the food system, and most importantly, they bring neighbours in contact with one another.\u201dMabee noted that \u201cmost people would assume that gardening attracts an older crowd, but it\u2019s amazing how many young people apply. It\u2019s because they want real vegetables. Tomatoes, carrots, eggplants, you name it, they grow it.\u201dMabee says her favourite part of building the gardens is seeing the benefit they add to the community.\u201cThere are so many different people that apply to garden, and its wonderful to see that gardening brings them all together,\u201d says Mabee. \u201cThe food that is grown helps the people live an affordable, healthy lifestyle.

During the 10th annual \u201c24 Hours of Homelessness\u201d event, participants with thick gloves and heavy coats collected donations between Rideau Street\u2019s Scotiabank branch \u2013 which donated $5,000 to the cause \u2013and the Highlander Pub.\u201cI blame myself for choosing the -40 wind-chill night,\u201d laughed Chez 106 host Eric Bollman, also known as Eric the Intern, rubbing his hands together. This was Bollman\u2019s ninth year working with OCH. During the week leading up to the event, he advertised 24 Hours of Homelessness over the radio and posted updates on Chez 106\u2019s Twitter page. Bollman said that the event is more about raising awareness than money.\u201cAfter tomorrow afternoon I get to go home and put on a fire and soak in a warm bath,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the kids who have to stay out overnight, they don\u2019t get to do that. They get to do this all over again. That\u2019s what we want to get people to realize.\u201d. Although the event is largely about spreading awareness, that hasn\u2019t stopped OCH from raising more than $10,000 in other years. This year, Operation Come Home is raising money to keep its new Self Matters program alive. The program, which relies on private donations to help youth turn their lives around, only has enough funding to run for one more eight-week rotation. \u201cWe\u2019re really relying on the donations from tonight to keep it running for the long term,\u201d said Lynda Franc, OCH\u2019s co-manager of operations. During a Self Matters rotation, four men or women under the age of 30 learn fundamental skills for working in the cosmetics industry. They spend the eight weeks learning aesthetics skills such as waxing or manicures as well as hairstyling and makeup artistry. For some of Ottawa\u2019s homeless young adults, Self Matters could be a step towards a more stable future. Participants can earn a high school credit through the program, and each rotation includes a field trip to one of the city\u2019s aesthetics schools, such as the Ottawa Academy on Ogilvie Road. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about learning how to apply makeup,\u201d says Ashley Mathieu, a member of OCH\u2019s support staff. \u201cIt\u2019s about the feeling you get whenever you leave the program at the end of the three hours, feeling great about yourself, feeling confident.\u201dMathieu teaches the program\u2019s two-week hairstyling section and helps run the other six weeks. Usually this means that the trainers demonstrate the day\u2019s lessons on her, and then students practise on each other.One of the men who volunteered for the 24 Hours of Homelessness fundraiser was 20- year-old Corey Illings from Hawkesbury, about 100 km east of Ottawa. Two years ago, he was spending almost every night outside. He slept in parking garages in Ottawa, and before that, in ATM lobbies or even under park benches in Hawkesbury.\u201cThere were a couple of nights where it was just really freezing,\u201d he said during the 24-hour event, wearing giant headphones to keep his ears warm. \u201cI\u2019d wake up and there\u2019d be a small layer of snow on me.\u201d When he was 18, Illings became involved with Operation Come Home. He took part in a program similar to Self Matters, which helped him learn job skills such as interview etiquette and how to write a good resum\u00e9. Today, Illings is studying general arts and sciences in Algonquin College. Next year, he plans to switch to child and youth services. He hopes to eventually become involved in programs similar to the ones that helped him.\u201cYou can adapt yourself to (living outside) but that\u2019s really hard to do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou kind of lose yourself.\u201d Operation Come Home hasn\u2019t finished calculating how much it raised from the 24\u2013hour event and preceding weeks, but the first tallies indicate that it was around $7,000, enough to support at least one more Self Matters rotation. When this rotation is complete, Mathieu says OCH will review the program financially. ",

    "body": "Dishcrawl returned to Ottawa this year with East Meets West, a collaborative culinary taste of Little Italy and Chinatown\u2019s best kept secrets.\r\rA Dishcrawl resembles a pub crawl, but instead of bars, patrons move from restaurant to restaurant. This is the first Dishcrawl to bring together the two neighbourhoods, says Dishcrawl ambassador Mat Wong, and the response indicates it might not be the last.For many people, going out to eat means visiting the same old restaurants and ordering the same old food. This is something Dishcrawl strives to bring to an end. Originally based in San Francisco, Dishcrawl first came to Ottawa in June 2011 with a tour of the Byward Market. It returned Feb. 5 and 6 with an excursion around Little Italy and Chinatown.\u00a0 Four restaurants within two of Ottawa\u2019s most popular ethnic neighbourhoods hosted a tour of food lovers both days. Each location was kept a secret until arrival. Customers were engaged in a meet and greet with the skilled chefs and a plated sample of their work. Chinatown and Little Italy are two culturally rich neighbourhoods, conveniently placed near one another. Wong explains that these locations, despite holding years of traditional immigrant culture, can be overlooked at times. \u201cI feel like these two districts are seen as historical but not necessarily \u2018trendy and hip\u2019 like other neighbourhoods such as the Glebe,\u201d Wong says, \u201cLittle Italy and Chinatown have numerous great restaurants. They may not look as fancy as some of the offerings in the Glebe, but quality-wise, the food can definitely give Glebe restaurants a run for their money.\u201dOttawa Food bloggers Don and Jen Chow of foodiePrints were scheduled to make an appearance. Don Chow had attended the Byward market Dishcrawl in 2010, and believes the event could prove beneficial to this year\u2019s neighbourhoods. Tour-based food tours, such as C\u2019est Bon\u2019s Walking Tours, help familiarize visitors with an area they might have otherwise considered foreign, according to Don.\u201cDishcrawl and walking tours of Preston by C\u2019est Bon Cooking break these stereotypes by making the neighbourhoods accessible,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting these two neighbourhoods to market themselves collectively would be more a function of getting the neighbourhood associations to collaborate. Dishcrawl is more of a one-off.\u201dWhile Centretown\u2019s Preston Street and Chinatown\u2019s Somerset Street attract attention in their own right, Dishcrawl brings the two together in a unique collaborative event. Whether there might be more joint marketing ventures between Little Italy and Chinatown in the future, the Preston BIA had no comment.\u201cChinatown and Preston BIA have been supporting and working with each other in many areas, and I am sure that we will be continuing to do so,\u201d says Grace Xin, executive director of the Chinatown BIA. Though Xin did not provide any past examples or future plans, there may soon be a growing demand for increased collaborations between Little Italy and Chinatown. \u00a0\u201cI think Dishcrawl brings so much to Chinatown and Little Italy,\u201d Simply Fresh blogger Jodi Larivi\u00e9re says, \u201cThey have both been areas that I wished I spent more time in. I think Dishcrawl is such a unique and wonderful way to get to know these neighbourhoods better.\u201dLarivi\u00e9re took full advantage of the Dishcrawl to satisfy her \u201cfoodie\u201d nature, a term used for avid food lovers. \u201cThere is nothing better than finding a new favourite spot to eat,\u201d Larivi\u00e9re says.\u00a0",

The store\u2019s front window fogged with visitors squeezing in on its reopening night on Jan. 26. This was after a makeover hiatus between late December and Jan 22. The ex-owner of After Stonewall, David Rimmer, was looking for someone to take over the business last summer. The business was earning less, partly because online books have become popular, Deyell says. \u201cDavid\u2019s always felt it (the store) needed to change, it needed something new fused into it,\u201d Deyell says.Rimmer\u2019s decision to sell the store coincided with Deyell\u2019s plan to move his gallery, \u201cfad: funktional art and design,\u201d from Prince Edward County near Belleville to Ottawa, Deyell says. The store\u2019s name comes from a historic event that helped trigger the gay pride movement. Police in New York City raided into a gay male bar, the Stonewall Inn in 1969. Patrons rebelled and it became news.Bookstores such as After Stonewall\u2019s are necessary, Deyell says, because as more people identify themselves as GLBTQ, they need to know that literature available to them and \u201cto tell them that it\u2019s okay.\u201dOn After Stonewall\u2019s glass shelves sit woodworks, jewellry and ceramics organized by colour. Other works include abstract paintings, recycled rubber goods and12 flavours of chocolate from Ontario chocolatiers that have their own shelf. At the end of the rectangular store are bookshelves encircling two plastic cream-white chairs and a coffee table. The books\u2019 genres include coming-out relationships, young adult and fiction.\u201cThe GLBTQ community, they can feel comfortable back here,\u201d Deyell cites that as one of the reasons putting the books at the back end of the store. Comfort is the key word for Deyell. \u201cHaving a book in my hand, wrapped up in a blanket in front of a fire place, with a glass of wine and some chocolate,\u201d is the kind of experience he wants to provide, Deyell says. \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable that the (independent) bookstores are going to have to diversify,\u201d says Ian Lee, a business strategy professor at Carleton University\u2019s Sprott School of Business. Unlike clothing stores that are more immune from online rivals, small bookstores will not survive just by selling books, Lee says. For clothes, customers \u201cwant to touch it and see it on them in the changing room, you don\u2019t have that issue with books.\u201d Deyell says niche bookstores with consistent demand might be viable without changing its business model. Change is what\u2019s happening in After Stonewall.

    "body": "\u201cI\u2019ve got these tremendous eyes,\u201d Chris Ralph bellowed early in Plosive Productions\u2019 adaptation of Billy Bishop Goes to War. It\u2019s a line that describes both the titular First World War flying ace and the actor playing him.\r\rThe musical, written by John Gray and Eric Peterson and performed at the Gladstone Theatre was a big challenge. The cast was small, consisting only of Ralph as Bishop and James Caswell as the narrator/pianist. As a result, Ralph had to be at the top of his game, playing the role convincingly and with enough gusto to last a full two hours.For the most part, Ralph passed with flying colours. Using those tremendous eyes, he conveyed the roguish charm, the angered bloodlust and the wearied resignation of a man deeply affected by war. Recounting his character\u2019s military school antics, Ralph\u2019s wide grin and squinting eyes painted a portrait of friendliness. This turned chilling when he described tearing apart a German plane with gunfire, those same features twisted into something more spiteful and savage.             Billy Bishop Goes to WarDirected by Terri Loretto-ValentikStarring Chris Ralph and James Caswell     In the play\u2019s more light-hearted moments, Ralph shifted on a dime, his conversational tone of voice instantly switching to a stiff military demeanour in no time flat. His rhythmic recital of a poem about British pilot Albert Ball was compelling, and carried solely on his haunted, sombre tone and his expressions.While Ralph\u2019s voice expertly sold his lines, it did cause him some trouble. The play features Bishop talking to other characters he meets throughout his life, meaning Ralph had to do many impressions throughout the night. When speaking with an accent, he sometimes faltered, maintaining a tone that was aristocratic but not always convincingly European.The music was similarly solid throughout with a few weak touches. Caswell made a perfect foil for Ralph, making the sounds of dropping bombs in a story about no man\u2019s land or slapping his knees to make a marching beat. Caswell\u2019s musical accompaniment, along with the lighting, helped keep Ralph\u2019s performance grounded by ratcheting up the tension in combat scenes. At other times, Caswell would chide or question Ralph, allowing the actor to vamp or build up for big laughs from the audience.Often, the duets between Caswell and Ralph soared on the two men\u2019s delivery, with Caswell singing his part while Ralph recited his. Occasionally, though, Ralph would sing, and his voice strained. This lent certain songs an immense sense of vulnerability, like one where Bishop sings a wistful song about fallen comrades. In more enthusiastic numbers, though, it was merely distracting.On the whole, Billy Bishop Goes to War\u2019s performances rocketed it into the stratosphere, though it dipped and dived a bit to get there.Billy Bishop Goes to War runs from Feb. 8-23 at the Gladstone Theatre.",

The city says the raise will help cover the replacement and rehabilitation costs of aging water and sewer infrastructure. Releasing multiple years\u2019 rates at once is a new approach. The city released rates for several years ahead of time, meaning businesses and residents will know approximately how much they will pay each coming year. If approved, the increases would mean an additional $46.70 on the average home\u2019s water bill in 2013, and an additional $50.05 in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the city predicts a six per cent increase. Coun. Maria McRae, chair of the city\u2019s environment committee, says that the budget \u201cstrikes a responsible balance between renewing aging infrastructure and ensuring ratepayers get best value for their dollar.\u201dSeventy per cent off the proposed increase is to be used for new infrastructure projects and renewing aging systems around Ottawa. \u201cWater and wastewater rates are the same for businesses as they are for residents,\u201d says Marian Simulik, Ottawa\u2019s city treasurer. \u201cMost businesses end up using less water than residences,\u201d she adds.

Marco Smith, a Centretown resident, says he supports the recommendations.\u00a0\u201cI mean, it\u2019s another $50 I don\u2019t want to spend on a necessity like water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut on the other hand, when infrastructure fails, like with the sinkholes and road collapses over the past few months, it makes sense that they are raising rates to fix this.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important that we look at this budget as a collective tool to solve some problems, but also to prevent problems from coming to future generations of Ottawans,\u201d says McRae.In addition to increasing the water and sewer water rates, the water and wastewater rate budget will also provide funding for the Ottawa River Action Plan, the Orleans Reliability Link, and Ottawa on the Move. The environment committee will be discussing the budget at their next meeting on Feb. 19.",

    "body": "The city released Centretown\u2019s community design plan to the public  Friday after completing a four-year study as part of its Liveable Ottawa  2031 project. \r\rThe report, prepared by Toronto-based planning and urban design company Urban Strategies Inc., provides a 20-year vision for the community, including recommendations to building height and massing, green space, transportation, heritage, and mixed-used development.Given Centretown\u2019s growing traffic problems, the study calls for major changes to the existing road networks, including revamping the streetscapes of major streets such as Elgin, Bank and Somerset to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars.Other suggestions includes converting one-way streets, such as Metcalfe Street, to normal two-way streets, closing down surface parking lots, and making right turns illegal on a red light at busy intersections.The plan focuses on urbanizing the city, so \u201cany further intensification in Centertown needs to be supported by a series of public realm improvements,\u201d reads the report. \u00a0It promotes \u2018greening\u2019 the community by upgrading and repairing existing parks and planting trees along the sidewalks of major streets.If accepted, the plan will amend the existing Centretown Secondary Plan from 1976.\u201cSecondary plans are used to implement the city\u2019s Official Plan at a local level and is one of the most important policy documents directing change and growth in a neighbourhood,\u201d according to the report.Although the 1976 plan included input from the Centretown Citizens Community Association (CCCA), its role in the neighbourhood\u2019s planning seems to have diminished.Having sent four letters to the city last year highlighting significant concerns about the draft plan, the finalized version presented to the association Feb. 11 appears to not even acknowledge the letters.\u201cWe\u2019re not happy,\u201d says CCCA vice-president Robert Dekker. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time on this document and to be told that our recommendations don\u2019t meet what the city is looking for is a slap to the community and what the community would like to see.\u201dAmong the concerns is the introduction of zoning areas that would allow up to 21 storeys, a height the association says is not justified.\u00a0 Another worry is the lack of short-term parking in Centretown.According to Dekker, the CCCA plans to meet with every member of the planning committee individually to discuss its concerns before the plan reaches the committee.\u00a0 They also aim to meet with the 23 councillors and the mayor. The community design plan will be presented at the planning committee meeting Mar. 26, chaired by Coun. Peter Hume, who could not be reached for comment.See the full plan at http://ottawa.ca/en/community-design-planSee the amendment at http://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/public-consultations/public-consultations-about-planning/draft-official-plan-amendment\u00a0",

It\u2019s not good enough just to say you understand really well what workers are up against every day when they go to work,\u201d says McKenny.McKenny says that the government needs to have discussions with businesses and labour unions to ensure there are jobs in the province.

As part of the process, three advisory panels were created, made up of councillors, people from the development industry and citizens r from local communities. None of the councillors or community representatives taking part live in the downtown core.Dekker says that, while he doesn\u2019t discount the people who were chosen to take part in the review, he is concerned about the lack of an urban representative who can ensure the liveability and the ability to move around communities such as Centretown will be maintained.He says the city told him downtown communities won\u2019t need specific representation because many \u2013 including Centretown \u2013 have community design plans. However, Dekker says it is a concern to have people who live in non-urban communities address his community\u2019s needs.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to call it an anti-urban bias, but I would like to say that the urban community can\u2019t be discounted for the value it brings to the City of Ottawa,\" Dekker says. The community consultation panel is composed of six representatives from different communities in the city. The Federation of Community Associations, a coalition of local community associations and non-profit groups, chose two representatives and three alternates. Barrhaven Ward councillor Jan Harder and Osgoode Ward councillor Doug Thompson, who chose two each, selected the other four.The FCA chose Sheila Perry, president of the Overbrook Community Association, and Gary Sealey, from the Kanata-Beaverbrook Community Association, while the councillors chose members of the Cedarhill and Barrhaven community associations.Bob Brocklebank, a member of the Glebe Community Association and one of the community panel alternates, says people in the downtown core should be more realistic about how much direct representation they will get.He says the federation did the best it could with limited space and that the panel will adequately represent urban Ottawa \u201cWhile it is true we don\u2019t have someone from Dalhousie, Centretown or Westboro, the fact is we were invited to name two people,\u201d Brocklebank says. \u201cAnd of the two, we have one from inside the Greenbelt \u2013 from the urban area \u2013 and one from outside the Greenbelt.\u201dMichael Powell, president of the Dalhousie Community Association, echoes that sentiment.Powell says that, while he would\u2019ve preferred a purely urban representative, the FCA has a good track record when it comes to representing all parts of the city. and reflecting its membership. He says there isn\u2019t much cause for concern because most issues that community associations deal with\u2014 such as zoning and making sure that development fits within the community\u2014 are common across all parts of the city.Powell says he only hopes the review will bring stability.\u201cWe want predictability so that we can have a sense of what our neighbourhood will see in terms of change, and not constantly be on the lookout for out of character proposals.\u201d",

Now that the distribution of the penny has been halted, charities and organizations in the city are looking for a way to give back \u2013 one cent at a time.\r\rMany organizations, including the Somerset West Community Health Centre, are encouraging those with spare pennies to donate them in support of local causes.Rosemary Jones, resource development manager at the health centre, started a penny drive to raise money for four after-school programs in the community. She says she got the idea to collect the coins \u2013 both rolled an unrolled \u2013 on the day they were phased out.Jones says the money will go towards giving children at the program school supplies and healthy snacks \u2013 both much needed since the children are mostly from low-income families.

He does so much for us,\u201d says Samantha Ingram, spokesperson for the Ottawa Food Bank. Ingram says the pennies raised will go towards purchasing food.

The plan will be presented to the city's planning committee at itsmeeting on March 26.See the full plan at http://ottawa.ca/en/community-design-plan For amendment suggestions go to http://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/public-consultations/public-consultations-about-planning/draft-official-plan-amendment .\u00a0",

David Chernushenko says the proposal is unnecessary when a councillor\u2019s annual budget must cover staffing, office equipment, hiring professionals and community donations.Councillors each had a budget of $234,000 in 2012.\u201cWe are all being reasonable with our budgets and we know it\u2019s transparent,\u201d Chernushenko says.Currently, Chernushenko makes donations to community associations, pays for planning reviews and purchases prizes for competitions. These contributions may be threatened if the proposal was to go ahead.One example, Chernushenko says, is his goal of enhancing the green space and atmosphere of streets by removing cars from narrow front yards. As there is no city program that covers this, his office plans to hire a professional city planning consultant at a cost of $10,000.However, if the proposal goes ahead, there would be no budget for such an idea, he says, which would constitute a serious problem.Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, says that the proposal is disempowering to the community and councillors.\u201cThe councillors are elected to work with the community and to support the community,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they need to be saddled with another regulation.\u201dBob Brocklebank, a member of the Federation of Community Associations, says the plan presents serious limitations for the community by reducing the community\u2019s civil engagement.Brocklebank says for citizen\u2019s associations issues such as renting halls for large community meetings could become a problem because the associations may not have the money to rent space without council assistance.",

    "body": "For the past week, Ottawa has joined the rest of Ontario in recognizing the importance of heritage by celebrating Heritage Week. \r\rOn Feb. 19, a heritage celebration was held at city hall, which allowed residents to learn about the local programs and initiatives for heritage conservation in their community. With 15 designated heritage districts in Ottawa, public involvement in the preservation of heritage and history is a necessity.Centretown has a rich history that is tied closely with the development of Canada. Its proximity to Parliament Hill has made it the backdrop to many of the nation\u2019s most important stories and moments, from behind-the-scenes politics to some of Canada\u2019s biggest achievements. It is these successes and stories that need to be remembered and should lie at the heart of heritage conservation. While preserving architecture to maintain the original feel of the community is necessary, remembering the history behind the buildings would not be possible without the support of the community. Educating residents of heritage communities and making them aware of the history of their house, street or neighbourhood will go a long way to preserving heritage culture and atmosphere.This idea of passing along this history is what makes cultural recognition ceremonies and holidays important. A focus on local heritage and history should be more prevalent in schools, garnering the same attention as national and political history.\u00a0 In a community such as Centretown, with its long and eventful history, this is especially important.A district heritage designation brings recognition to a community; however the designation does little more than flag the buildings of architectural and heritage value in a city database.Since the start of community heritage designations in 1982, the city and heritage groups have been protecting historical building around Ottawa from disrepair and demolition. The most recent example is the possible future demolition of a historic building on Bank and Flora streets. \u00a0The city\u2019s planning committee recently approved its demolition and city council will make the final decision on Feb. 27. This old European Glass and Paint building will be replaced by a nine-storey condominium of brick, metal and glass. This is similar to two other condominiums that were recently built a couple of blocks over on Gladstone Avenue. While the new building does not have the heritage value of the European Glass and Paint building, the completed condo will have other benefits for the neighbourhood.\u00a0 It will be bigger than the old building, and cover up the adjoining old parking lot. It will also be further back from the street, making the corner more pedestrian-friendly.Despite these benefits, tearing down a building with heritage value should not be taken lightly.\u00a0 If the city council agrees to demolish the building, the community must ensure that its historical importance and memories are preserved.As of now, heritage conservation rests of the shoulders of city council and local heritage groups. However, with annual events such as Heritage Week, hopefully there will be increasing interest in local history.",

Yet it is underfunded and uses outdated eligibility criteria, depriving veterans and short-changing their families when their loved one passes away.The fund will pay up to only $3,600 to cover veterans\u2019 funeral costs which does not come close to covering the actual cost of a proper funeral. All but a few veterans who have served since the Korean War are excluded from the program. Families who do apply have faced a staggering rejection rate of over 60%. Over 20,000 veterans have been excluded over the past six years. Families of veterans must pay the full cost themselves unless they are nearly destitute.The Veterans Affairs department has the gall to claim this is \u201cone of the most comprehensive programs\u201d.No amount of political spin can change the reality that far too many of our veterans are not getting the respect they earned and deserve when they dies. \u00a0The Veterans\u2019 Ombudsmen, Royal Canadian Legion and department officials recommend that access to the program be expanded and funding be increased so it can meet the needs of veterans and their families.

    "body": "Many of us have one: a jar of coins that sits on a bedroom table or a dresser.\r\rBut it only holds the odd loonie or toonie and there aren\u2019t even many dimes or quarters. It\u2019s the one- and five-cent pieces that fill the jar.In fact, the Government of Canada website cites \u201cthe increased accumulation of pennies by Canadians\u201d as one of the reasons for ceasing to distribute the coin.Retailers now round to the nearest five-cents in cash transactions. If customers pay electronically, prices don\u2019t change.But the Royal Canadian Mint shouldn\u2019t stop scrapping coins after eliminating the copper-plated piece. It should do away with the nickel as well.The idea\u2019s gaining traction. Winnipeg Centre MP Pat Martin says he plans a private member\u2019s bill to discontinue the country\u2019s new least-valuable coin.He\u2019s not the only one who supports the idea. The mint should stop producing the nickel in a couple of years, says John Palmer, a retired Western University economics professor who argued for penny\u2019s elimination less than three years ago.Waiting two years would allow people to get used to the penny\u2019s absence before rounding to the closest 10-cent-mark, he says. But he says he\u2019s already prepared to get rid of the nickel.\u201cI find it useless already,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t buy much with them, then we shouldn\u2019t have them.\u201dMany Canadians, too, may already be willing to give up the five-cent piece.Desjardins, one of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions, conducted a poll six years ago that revealed half of Canadians don\u2019t use the coin. That will rise to two-thirds by 2017, says a report the group released in 2008.If Canadians don\u2019t buy anything with nickels, they don\u2019t circulate. This forces the mint to produce more of the coins each year.The mint issued more than 135 million five-cent pieces in 2002, says the Desjardins report. That number rose to almost 228 million in 2011, a 40-per-cent increase, according to the mint\u2019s 2011 annual report.Though the mint says it costs less than five cents to make a nickel, they aren\u2019t cheap to hand out.The Crown corporation loses $3.6 million every year distributing five-cent coins to banks, according to a study a Wilfrid Laurier University economics professor published in 2003.Since the number of nickels the mint ships has increased,\u00a0 it\u2019s likely the amount it loses has, too.Why would it throw away money to distribute five-cent coins, especially with the rising use of electronic transactions?More often than not, customers reach into their wallets for debit and credit cards to buy inexpensive items, such as coffee, Centretown businesses say.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more. I\u2019d say about two-thirds of our transactions are put through debit and credit,\u201d says Kate Veinot, director of operations at Auntie Loo\u2019s Treats at 507 Bronson Ave.Though the bakery largely profits by selling speciality orders and baking for other stores, Veinot says business picked up when she started allowing patrons to pay electronically two years ago.It doesn\u2019t cost much to buy a couple of cookies or cupcakes, but she says walk-in customers don\u2019t have to worry about carrying enough money with them.The convenience of debit and credit cards has also resulted in about two-thirds of customers using them at The Daily Grind on Somerset Street West, near Percy Street, says manager Sean Hyatt.But Hyatt says eliminating the nickel would be unfair to the caf\u00e9\u2019s patrons, as they could risk losing more money in the rounding process. Like Palmer, Veinot says there has to be an adjustment period for stores and their clients before talk starts about scrapping the nickel.Palmer also argues that customers, such as ones at The Daily Grind, wouldn\u2019t have to pay more money if the government stopped producing the coin.New Zealand discontinued one- and two-cent coins in 1990. Its five-cent piece followed in 2006.The Australian government, which halted production of its one- and two-cent pieces a year after New Zealand, is considering following in its southern neighbour\u2019s footsteps again.New Zealanders adjusted well to the end of their five-cent coin, Palmer says.\u201cIt\u2019s straightforward rounding to the nearest 10 cents, Sometimes you round up, sometimes you round down. In fact, some retailers made a point to round down during cash transactions.\u201dBusinesses in New Zealand don\u2019t always charge shoppers an extra 10 cents. Though they can easily round up, they avoid it to compete against rival retailers.Why wouldn\u2019t Canadian businesses do the same? Not only could the mint save money by halting production of an unpopular coin that\u2019s becoming increasingly obsolete\u00a0 but people may be able to take advantage of stores\u2019 competitive natures to find better deals.In a few years, it\u2019d be best if the nickel became a mere collector\u2019s item.",

But, it poses several concerns about civil liberties and the way Canada treats its immigrants. The bill, called the Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act, stretches the boundaries of the definition \u201cforeign criminal,\u201d allowing for a reduction in the appeal process for immigrants and vague discretion on behalf of Immigration Minister Jason Kenney to reject applications touting ambiguous \u201cpublic policy\u201d concerns. Right now, individuals sentenced to less than two years for an offence, maintain the right to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division, which hears and decides on appeals on immigration matters such as removal orders. Under the proposed changes, the right to appeal is only available to those sentenced less than six months. Not many will argue against the removal of hardened criminals who continually break the law. It\u2019s the permanent residents, who don\u2019t have Canadian citizenship that will be swept along with this vague bill that we need to worry about. This change won\u2019t remove foreign criminals faster, it will mean resident minors and one-time offenders are haphazardly grouped among career criminals.The bill hasn\u2019t escaped opposition though, having been controversial since its first reading. It\u00a0 has been criticized by legal organizations and opposition parties. NDP MP Sadia Groguh\u00e9 has said in the House of Commons that the Conservatives are betraying Canada\u2019s tradition of welcoming immigrants and protecting basic human rights. The Canadian Bar Association isn\u2019t happy either; it has quickly dismissed a majority of the changes as unnecessary and unreasonable, calling it a \u201cone-size-fits-all denial of appeal rights.\u201d And it\u2019s that one-size-fits-all, one-strike-and-you\u2019re-out foundation that makes this bill both appalling and controversial. It is likely that with a majority government, the bill will become law. But in doing so, individuals whose families reside in this country, who likely have established ties in their community and possibly don\u2019t speak the language of their country of origin will be the most affected.Essentially, the bill doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019ve lived in Canada for the majority of your life or have otherwise been a law-abiding citizen.In fact, Kenney has indicated that should the families of those affected by this bill desire, they can accompany them back to their home country.\u201c(The family members) are welcome to go back to their country,\u201d he said.This isn\u2019t the legislation Canada\u2019s government should be putting forward while at the same time lauding its immigration policies. When it is approved, as is likely, our global reputation as an accepting, multicultural nation will suffer. \u00a0",

The Canadian Film Institute is giving audiences the opportunity to see an American film director as they\u2019ve never seen him before.\r\rThe institute, along with the U.S. embassy is presenting American Possibility: The Cinema of Hal Hartley. The retrospective has already featured three Hartley films, a selection of his short films and daily appearances from the director from Feb. 1-3. It runs from Feb. 27 to March 2, with Hartley\u2019s movies Henry Fool, The Girl from Monday, and Fay Grim playing at the Library\u00a0 and Archives Canada Auditorium on Wellington Street.Hartley was an obvious choice for a retrospective, says the institute\u2019s executive director Tom McSorley. After attracting a lot of attention in the early 1990s with films like The Unbelievable Truth and Trust, Hartley remained independent of the major studio system.While mainstream appeal has alluded Hartley, McSorley says the filmmaker\u2019s talent lies in his differences from Hollywood. \u201cHartley\u2019s work is much (smaller) in its scale, much larger in its ideas than most of the stuff we get through,\u201d McSorley says. \u201cPlus, he\u2019s a very good commentator and storyteller about America, particularly pre-9/11 and post-9/11. I think his films are some of the most interesting reflections of that country\u2019s recent decade, for example, than anyone we\u2019ve seen anywhere else.\u201dWhile McSorley praises Hartley\u2019s post-9/11 work, he admits that much of the buzz around the filmmaker has died down in the last decade. The retrospective focuses as much on Hartley\u2019s later films as his earlier work. This gives viewers a chance to see more eclectic, shorter films that aren\u2019t as readily available elsewhere, McSorley says.\u201c(Hartley)\u2019s done a variety of kinds of filmmaking that are very difficult to see in traditional exhibition spaces,\u201d McSorley says. \u201cSo I thought that focusing on that for this retrospective would give it a kind of unique quality, and also show his later period stuff to be as interesting, if not more interesting and relevant than his early stuff.\u201dThis attention to smaller films endears the institute to movie junkies, says Bruce White, the programmer at the ByTowne Cinema. The theatre works with the institute and the Embassy of France to show unreleased French-language films.\u201cFor a film fan, it\u2019s very important to see as many movies as possible,\u201d he says, \u201cwhether they have big releases in commercial theatres or whether they\u2019re festival-type films. The CFI provides that latter type of film to the Ottawa audience.\u201dThe institute also acts as a credible source for recommendations, says Ottawa Film Society treasurer Michel Rossignol. It offers eclectic movie ideas that the film society can then show members later.\u201cOften their films are not readily available, or become available later,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they give us the opportunity to view the best films for our membership.\u201dThe institute can meet his demand because it is in the capital, McSorley says. Many embassies in the city are available and willing to promote films from their country to a foreign audience. This allows the non-profit institute to operate in a way that commercial organizations cannot.\u201cWe fit into a niche, obviously,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not the be all and end all. There are lots of great things in commercial movies and theatres, too. We just kick the door open a little bit wider, I guess.\u201d",

    "body": "Perhaps it\u2019s appropriate that Ottawa\u2019s most talked about nighttime event so far this year didn\u2019t take place in a club or a bar, but at an establishment with a far more staid reputation. \r\rThat didn\u2019t dampen anticipation among Ottawans of all ages when the Museum of Nature opened up its doors for the first Nature Nocturne on Jan. 26. Marketed as a DJ-assisted dance party amid the exhibits, the soir\u00e9e went on to garner reviews ranging from rave approval to outright dismissal.The museum\u2019s transformation into a pseudo-club (albeit one with a tragically flawed bar system) was lauded by many in the community for both its ability to draw in a younger crowd and its unconventionally amusing atmosphere. However, that appraisal wasn\u2019t unanimous, and those who regularly peruse Vice.com probably stumbled across a particularly vitriolic \u2013 and patently unfair \u2013 review written by a Carleton University student.The writer is a prime example of the demographic that is most likely to express its discontent at such events \u2013 and towards Ottawa\u2019s cultural offerings in general. And while the article may have elicited enthusiastic praise from some people who read it as a cathartic response to the city\u2019s all-too-often uninspiring nightlife, the piece had some serious flaws. To start, its criticisms largely failed to extend beyond mean-spirited and superficial jabs at the appearances of certain attendees \u2013 their weights, ages and attire are all inspiration for a series of cheap shots that have no bearing on the merit of the event itself. It seems that the editors of Vice have realized this too; the article was quietly pulled from their website after igniting a firestorm of comments.More significantly, though, it overlooked a much more relevant theme \u2013 that it can sometimes feel like there\u2019s a significant gap in the city\u2019s entertainment scene after dark. The people who tend to complain about that phenomenon are, more often than not, students. They\u2019re the ones who, after having lived in Ottawa only a few months, may label it as \u201cboring\u201d or \u201cuptight.\u201d They also belong to a population typically marked by transience \u2013 a definition best supported by frequent declarations of their intent to vacate the city as soon as their academic sentences are up. I should know. I\u2019m well known for expressing that very sentiment. But I do so with full awareness of the fact that my hypercritical grievances regarding Ottawa\u2019s artistic and cultural landscape will, beyond the agreeable nods of my peers, fall on deaf ears. That\u2019s in part because those arguments are admittedly emotional, poorly crafted, and unsupported by any real research (not unlike that Vice article). In reality, however, Ottawa has plenty to bring to the table if you\u2019re willing to take advantage of institutions such as the NAC and the Ottawa Little Theatre. Or, if you look a little harder you can easily find less-publicized events put on by those in the community who are working to change Ottawa\u2019s image as a stodgy government town. They run the gamut from enterprising blog editors to concert promoters, and because of their efforts, there\u2019s an ever-growing supply of sufficiently hip diversions fit for even the most dubious would-be revelers.Perhaps the writer of that disparaging review had a point and the metaphorical fanny-pack to handbag ratio at Ottawa\u2019s late night functions is somewhat above the norm when compared to other major Canadian cities. Maybe the buttoned-up civil servants who come out after dark aren\u2019t the same figures that populate the most Bacchic dreams of the city\u2019s 20-something crowd. But at the end of the day, a city\u2019s character can\u2019t be expected to change simply to entertain waves of newcomers, who will be gone at their first chance, especially. With some imagination, it\u2019s easy enough to find fun or create your own. So to those who might lament a lack of quality nocturnal amusements around town, perhaps it\u2019s time to rethink whether or not the city should \u2013 or ever will \u2013 conform to your tastes. Or better yet, maybe it\u2019s time to change it for yourself.",

Students are not the only ones being affected by the Ontario public teachers\u2019 work-to-rule action. Centretown\u2019s museums and arts institutions are also feeling the effects of Ottawa\u2019s public school teachers refusing to take their students on field trips. \r\rSome of Ottawa\u2019s public high school teachers have been withholding extra-curricular activities since September as a means of protesting the Government of Ontario\u2019s controversial Bill 115. The Elementary Teachers\u2019 Federation of Ontario, the union representing public elementary teachers, moved into an official work-to-rule action in early December, as did the Ontario Secondary School Teachers\u2019 Federation, the union representing Ontario\u2019s high school teachers.Several cultural institutions in Centretown have been affected by the teachers\u2019 action, including the Canadian Museum of Nature and the National Arts Centre .Gilles Proulx, who co-ordinates school programming at the Museum of Nature, says he realized in September that attendance for this year would be lower when the museum received fewer reservations from Ottawa-Carleton District School Board than usual. Since January, he has received several cancellations from the few public schools that reserved for this year. He says the museum expects revenues to be lower this year because of the action.The museum continues to reach out to the school boards that are not affected, such as the French and Catholic school boards, says Proulx, so programming is unchanged and the museum has not suffered a substantial loss in revenue.\u201cWe\u2019ve been quite lucky throughout the year to have the support of all the other school boards,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re functioning normally.\u201dThe Bytown Museum has had a similar experience, says executive director Robin Etherington. While there was a slight reduction in visitors in the fall, the museum is doing quite well.\u201cIn fact, the French and Catholic schools have made up the difference (in attendance),\u201d Etherington says.The NAC, however, has not been as fortunate. Three out of five matinee performances of an opera for youth called Sanctuary Song have been cancelled, says NAC spokesperson Mary Gordon. She says Innocence Lost, a play set to open March, is at risk of cancellation. \u201cWe program these terrific shows for young people and it\u2019s sad when they can\u2019t attend,\u201d she says.Gordon says the NAC has strong relationships with all the school boards, so schools in other boards are still attending. However, since the performances affected are matinees, it\u2019s difficult to appeal to other audiences to make up for the loss.\u201cThere isn\u2019t really anything we can do, we\u2019re just hoping for a quick resolution to the conflict,\u201d Gordon says.Ottawa-Carleton Elementary Teachers\u2019 Federation president, Peter Giuliani, says even though trips might occur during school hours, they fall under the work-to-rule action because they require substantial planning outside a teacher\u2019s regular hours.\u201cOrganizing a field trip is a huge job,\u201d Giuliani says. \u201cThey are 100 per cent voluntary and they are a boatload of work.\u201dGiuliani says the Elementary Teachers\u2019 Federation of Ontario hopes to resolve the blockade on extracurricular activities by March 1. He says he\u2019s unsure if teachers will want to start organizing trips again even if the action is dropped because they\u2019ve been \u201cvilified\u201d by the government and community for the action.\u201cThe teachers have learned that no good deed goes unpunished.\u201d",

The Ottawa International Children\u2019s Festival is a five-day event that offers children the best of performing arts from across Canada and abroad. Held at the LeBreton Flats and the neighbouring Canadian War Museum in early June, the festival has grown since its inception in 1985 to become a fun, one-of-a-kind field trip for children. The live performances already booked for this year include a dance team from the United States, a theatre troupe from Denmark, and a Quebec choreographer. More than 20,000 people attended last year\u2019s festival and those numbers were expected to rise. That is, until the teacher\u2019s labour dispute got serious. \u00a0\u201cWe have only been able to garner a small fraction of early bookings through schools that we would have had by this time in previous years,\u201d says Patrick Mc Cormack, the festival\u2019s media marketing co-ordinator.Children from more than 140 schools attend the festival most years, a far cry from the schools expected to bring their students this year.The many no-show notices that have and are still coming in from schools across the city could come amount to a huge financial loss for the festival, says Mc Cormack.\u201cThere could definitely be some serious consequences if we push forward and are not able to garner the type of attendance that we\u2019ve had in the past,\u201dMcCormack adds. The lion\u2019s share of the festival\u2019s revenue (around 90 per cent) comes from the students themselves, who pay $8 for a day to attend the performances. But it\u2019s not just annual festivals that are being affected by the ongoing dispute.. According to Rosemary Thompson, a spokeswoman for the National Arts Cenjtre, the NAC has had to significantly reduce the number of children\u2019s shows as a result of the teachers\u2019 job action.",

    "body": "Details surrounding the recent announcement of a smoke-free Bluesfest are hazy.\r\rThis year\u2019s festival, which takes place July 4-14 at LeBreton Flats, near the Canadian War Museum, will be \u201ccompletely smoke-free\u201d with no designated smoking areas, according to Mike Rouleau, director of operations for RBC Royal Bank Bluesfest.The decision \u201cwas based on requests by our city and NCC partners, on feedback and requests we\u2019ve received from patrons and just the way society is moving,\u201d Rouleau says.On Jan. 29, organizers announced on Facebook that a performance by blues legend B.B. King will close Bluesfest 2013.Organizers say if a musician lights up onstage, the show will go on. But they have yet to give details on how they will enforce a smoke-free policy in a culture where cigarettes are commonplace.\u201cIt will be strongly suggested and enforced as much as we can,\u201d Rouleau says. \u201cWhoever is going to do the enforcement \u2013 we don\u2019t know who that is \u2013 for example, can\u2019t like run up on stage. So there are things that we have to work around.\u201dThe Ottawa Council on Smoking and Health and the Academy of Medicine Ottawa announced the policy. Both congratulated Bluesfest and the National Capital Commission for \u201cadopting a voluntary 100-per-cent smoke-free policy, beginning this summer,\u201d in a Jan. 21 press release.There was speculation about whether last year\u2019s festival would be smoke-free when the City of Ottawa adopted a no-smoking bylaw for outdoor patios, city-owned parks, and beaches.The bylaw does not apply to the NCC land on which Bluesfest takes place. The NCC does not have the power to enact similar policies or enforce a smoking ban, says Jean Wolff, spokesman for the federal agency.The Jan. 21 press release \u201cis inaccurate in the details because there is no new policy at the NCC,\u201d Wolff says.This year is, however, the first time Bluesfest will be required to comply with the NCC\u2019s current policy, which discourages smoking at events.Last summer, the agency added a clause to event permit contracts that requires permit holders to clearly advertise that people attending the event should voluntarily not smoke.\u201cWe advertise that we want activities to be in a smoke-free environment. It means that we discourage people to smoke and that we respect other people\u2019s space,\u201d Wolff says.Smoke-free spaces like the one proposed by Bluesfest are meant to limit health hazards posed by second-hand smoke. \u201cSecond-hand smoke can affect your health even for a short time, like within minutes,\u201d says Dr. Aly Abdulla, vice-president of the Academy of Medicine Ottawa. \u201cIt can irritate your eyes, nose, lungs, and allergies or breathing issues like asthma. \"Of course, we already know about lung cancer, heart disease, lung and ear infections, and asthma.\"",

A new NHL movement launched in partnership with the seven Canadian hockey teams this month hopes to broaden awareness of mental health issues while removing the stigma associated with getting help.\r\rFor the Hockey Talks initiative, each Canadian NHL team hosts a game night where the team fundraises for a charity in its community. Beyond this financial help, teams dedicate time during the game to educate fans about mental health issues and encourage families to talk about them.This countrywide program was in development for close to two years, says Sens Foundation president Danielle Robinson. The foundation has hosted games dedicated to Daron Richardson, the daughter of Ottawa Senators ex-assistant coach Luke Richardson, who took her own life in November 2010. These games were all held in February, Daron\u2019s birth month.\u201cI gathered all of the Canadian teams together for a bit of a conversation, asking them if they would like to do a night like this,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cThrough a series of other tragic events on some of the other teams, everything just came together for (Hockey Talks).\u201dFor the game at Scotiabank Place Feb. 23, the Senators will continue supporting the Do It For Daron Fund, an organization in Richardson\u2019s name that focuses on youth mental health awareness and research.During this game, as well as other Hockey Talks evenings across Canada, information about mental health plays on arena screens, followed by a list of resources to help fans that are in need. Players are also donning decals with the words \u201cHockey Talks\u201d on their helmets throughout February to generate awareness around the league.Fans and players are also prompted to share their experiences on team websites and Twitter, spreading their messages with the hashtag #hockeytalks.\u201cAs an NHL club, we have a really strong brand and our players are role models,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cChildren and youth see that they\u2019re talking about these things. Hopefully it will inspire conversations and people getting more help thinking it\u2019s OK to talk about.\u201dThe death of Rick Rypien, a Vancouver Canucks forward who committed suicide in August 2011, also sparked league discussion about mental health. Rypien suffered from clinical depression during his career. At the Hockey Talks game in Vancouver on Feb. 1, Rypien\u2019s brother, Wes, dropped the puck in a commemorative pre-game ceremony.Hockey Talks comes at a key time for Canadians, as mental health concerns are growing across the country. The National Mental Health Strategy, launched in May 2012 by the Mental Health Commission of Canada, calls for more prevention programs in everyday settings to reduce the stigma associated with finding help.\u201cThere\u2019s been a need for mental health awareness and training. . .\u00a0\u00a0 for the spectrum of mental health services,\u201d says Ren\u00e9e Ouimet, a spokesperson for the Canadian Mental Health Association\u2019s Ottawa branch. \u201cThere have been some high-profile situations that have brought (mental health issues) to light.\u201dMoney raised from the Feb. 23 showdown in Ottawa against the Toronto Maple Leafs will go to an educational program created by the Royal Ottawa Hospital, called \u201cIs It Just Me?\u201d The program plans to bring 4,000 high-school students in the Ottawa area to the Royal to educate them about mental health this year, says Andr\u00e9e Steel, president of the Royal Ottawa.Earlier this year, the Sens Foundation pledged $100,000 to the Royal Ottawa to sponsor its Early Identification and Intervention program. Money is also going toward a Royal Ottawa research program in regional high schools to test a mental health curriculum for school boards.Suicide is the second largest cause of death for Canadians ages 15 to 24. The Canadian Mental Health Association states that between 10 and 20 per cent of Canadian youth have a mental illness or disorder. From that group, only one in five seek help.Robinson says that with a successful national launch this February, the initiative may migrate to the United States in future years, where mental health is currently a hot-button issue.",

    "body": "Only one year to go till\u00a0 all the pageantry and pomp we associate with the Winter Olympics grips the small city of Sochi, Russia, and the Olympic cauldron is lit.\r\rBut there is a slight hiccup on the horizon.One of the highlights (for Canadian fans at least) of the Olympics is under threat from paperwork, administration and greed.The NHL and the International Olympic Committee have yet to agree on players competing in the Olympics.As with many things, it all boils down to money.Essentially, the NHL is threatening to schedule games during the Olympics. This means players won\u2019t be able to represent their home countries.They will allow players to head to Sochi, if certain criteria are met.The NHL wants the IOC to guarantee insurance for injuries, access to players\u2019 regular doctors, a larger portion of revenue from the games as well as a shortened selection camp.However, the IOC seems unwilling to meet these demands and has started taking shots at Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner. In an interview on CBC television, Ren\u00e9 Fasel the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s president, said that blocking any potential agreement is the \u201cego from some people in North America.\u201dAfter the public relations war that engulfed the NHL lockout this year, this is the last thing the NHL needs.From 1954 until 1991, there was no agreement between the NHL and the IOC to allow time off from the NHL schedule to attend the Olympics. This deprived hockey greats such as Bobby Orr and Gordie Howe the opportunity to participate in the Olympics and add to their own trophy haul.Professional players were finally allowed to join the Olympic team in 1977 but due to scheduling\u00a0 NHL players were only able to join after being eliminated from the Stanley Cup.An agreement was finally struck in 1991 when the NHL agreed to not schedule any games during the Winter Olympics to finally give players the opportunity to represent their country.Since then, Canada has won its only two medals, both gold, for hockey.The gold medal game in Vancouver at the last Winter Olympics set a Canadian record for viewers. Roughly 16.6 million Canadians turned on their TVs, whether it be in bars or at their homes, to watch Canada edge Team USA 3-2 in overtime.That was up from the 10.3 million who tuned in during 2002.Sidney Crosby\u2019s overtime winner in the 2010 final saw fans dancing in the streets of Vancouver and created a new memory for a younger generation of fans.Simply put, why ruin a good thing?Stories of loonies being frozen in to rinks to guarantee good luck, overtime victories and competing against our neighbours to the South have all added to the entertainment of the Winter Olympics.Olympic hockey has grown in popularity with superstars such as Alexander Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby took to the ice to play for their countries.In 2002, the game was shown on two channels: the CBC and the French SRC. In 2010, nine channels all showed the game allowing for more people to tune in and cheer on their team.Why allow an argument about more money jeopardize the popularity of the Olympics and hockey?Fans have already seen the feuding over money in hockey with the NHL lockout only two months gone.The animosity drove a wedge between fans of the sport and the people behind it, with both the players and owners getting the blame.For Canadians, there\u2019s something special about pulling on a jersey and representing your country and its iconic sport.\u201cIt\u2019s just an honour to be on the team,\u201d said Scott Neidermayer after being selected to participate in the 2010 Winter Olympics.The opportunity to play at home, in front of friends and family, has lured Russian players. When prominent players such as Evgeni Malkin and Ovechkin are threatening to play no matter what, then the NHL has no choice but come to an agreement.If you lose some of the league\u2019s brightest and most visible stars, how do you discipline them for wanting to represent their country? Where would the punishments end?With bad blood already existing between hockey fans and the NHL, a quick resolution would help not only fans but also the NHL\u2019s PR.",

Earle Morris had already mapped out a storybook ending to the Scotties Tournament of Hearts before it even started.\r\r\u201cI hope that we get to the final, I hope that it\u2019s all tied up coming home, I hope that the last rock is made, and I hope we have the hammer,\u201d says Morris.Before they leave for the Scotties though, Team Homan practices at the Ottawa Curling Club on O\u2019Connor Street. Between a couple laughs, the team is focused. It spends almost an hour doing one drill working on throwing consistencies, co-ordinated by coach Morris. Finally, it\u2019s over; another hard day\u2019s work.\u201cI\u2019ve never worked with a team that\u2019s worked harder than this team,\u201d says Morris of the 2013 Ontario provincial champions.Thanks to that hard work, Team Homan earned the right to represent Ontario in the 2013 national championship in Kingston this week. It won the Ontario provincial championship in Waterloo, Jan. 21-27, going 11-0 in the process.The Ottawa-based team is led by Rachel Homan, who at only 23 years of age is already one of the best in the game, according to her coach.\u201cTo me, Rachel has always been the best shot-making skip in curling,\u201d says Morris. \u201cIf you take a look at the successful skips in curling, they\u2019re all in their thirties, those that have won world championships. Well, here\u2019s a young lady that\u2019s only 23.\u201dAlso 23 years old are teammates Alison Kreviazuk and Emma Miskew. Lisa Weagle, the fourth member of the squad, is the veteran at age 27. All four team members grew up in Ottawa.Homan, Kreviazuk, and Miskew have been curling together since they were 12 years old, all the while coached by Morris. The exception being the last two seasons when Morris coached Olympian Jennifer Jones for a year, then took a year away from curling. He returned to the rink this season after being asked by his old team. \u201cWe got on our hands and knees,\u201d admits Kreviazuk. Weagle joined the team three years ago.Team Homan returns to the national championships after finishing fourth in 2011 in Charlottetown. This time, it gets to be the host team.\u201cBeing the home province, getting crowd advantage \u2013 it\u2019s going to be really neat,\u201d says Kreviazuk. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it a lot.\u201dTeam Homan has been the most financially successful team in the world during the 2012-13 season, having earned $52,300 over six tournaments \u2013 or slams, as they are called in curling. Morris likes their chances going into the Scotties and he\u2019s not alone.\u201cIf you listen to what the media says, we\u2019re co-favourites,\u201d says Morris. \u201cI think that makes a lot of sense based on the success we\u2019ve had this year. We\u2019re the leading money winner on the World Curling Tour and we\u2019ve got a great record against the other top ten teams.\u201dOne of the team's long-term goals is to represent Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. But in the short term, it would like to represent Canada at the World Championships in Riga, Latvia, March 16-24, which will happen if it wins in Kingston.\u201cEver since I started curling it\u2019s been a dream of mine to wear the maple leaf,\u201d says Kreviazuk. \u201cI think it would be really exciting to win.\u201dIn the immediate future, the team only has one goal: making the playoffs at the 2013 Scotties Tournament of Hearts.And while Kreviazuk, Homan, and Weagle all agree that their goal is to make the tournament playoffs, they acknowledge that there is more to it than winning this time around.\u201cI think we also really want to enjoy the experience,\u201d says Weagle. \u201cBeing able to play at a national championship is really exciting and we\u2019re going to have lots of fan support there so I think we just want to take it all in and enjoy it but also stay focused on our goals.\u201dOf course, a gold medal wouldn\u2019t hurt either.\u201cWe have so much support and friends and family coming to cheer us on and it would just be amazing to kind of share that win with them,\u201d says Homan. \u201cIt would just be kind of surreal at first. I\u2019m just excited to get to Scotties and start the event.\u201d",

His coaches and teammates say he has a great work ethic, a lot of talent, and a ton of potential.\r\rThat\u2019s pretty good for a freshman.\u201cI\u2019ve had a really good year,\u201d says the 18-year-old Lisgar Collegiate grad, who is in his first year of mechanical engineering at Carleton. \u201cI\u2019ve improved a lot in certain aspects of my skiing and I\u2019m still looking to improve, but it\u2019s been going really well.\u201dWilkinson-Zan began cross-country skiing when he was three, joined local club Nakkertok Nordic\u2019s racing team in Grade 5 and now logs more than 600 hours a year in ski training, racing for both Nakkertok and Carleton Raven\u2019s 21-member varsity team. Both teams ski in Gatineau Park.He says it\u2019s a lot to manage, but has been able to do well so far by taking only three courses per semester.\u201cIt\u2019s really good to get a better balance with school and skiing,\u201d he says of the lighter courseload.Carleton Ravens head coach Chris Mamen says learning to juggle skiing and school helps athletes develop over their university years.\u201cThey tend to be able to balance things a lot better,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means that they do end up skiing faster and it\u2019s because of better time management. Their body responds better.\u201dThe training is more extreme than Wilkinson-Zan says he's used to.\u201cThe level of commitment and dedication for university skiing is higher and the training is more intense than high school skiing,\u201d Wilkinson-Zan said. \u201cIn most parts it\u2019s a natural transition to a higher level, but the one big difference is the addition of the new technique.\u201dIn high school, athletes compete only in skate skiing, whereas they participate in both classic and skate races in university, he said.Wilkinson-Zan was last year\u2019s national junior skate ski sprint champion and in Grade 11 was named Lisgar\u2019s male athlete of the year after winning the Ontario Federation of School Athletic Association\u2019s Nordic championships. \u201cIn the beginning of high school, I wasn\u2019t much of a high level skier,\u201d Wilkinson-Zan says. \u201cI skied because I enjoyed it, but never threw down some substantial results. In Grade 10, I started to take it much more seriously and started placing regularly in the top 10.\u201dNordic skiing is popular at Lisgar, with about 40 athletes on the team in Wilkinson-Zan\u2019s graduating year. Many also ski with Nakkertok, he says.While natural talent does play a role in his success, Nakkertok head coach Kieran Jones says a lot of the young skier\u2019s is the result of pure hard work.\u201cHe\u2019s the type of guy who\u2019s on time, he\u2019s ready for practice every day and he\u2019s always keen to learn more,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI would say I probably field more questions from him than I have from any athlete that I\u2019ve worked with.\u201dWilkinson-Zan says he and the Carleton team have their eyes on the gold medal at the Ontario University Athletics championships Feb. 22 at Lakehead. Both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams captured the silver medal at last year\u2019s OUAs and the men won gold in 2010 and 2011.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a strong one this year,\u201d Wilkinson-Zan says of the team. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a decent shot at getting the OUA banner.\u201dMamen says it\u2019s important for the younger skiers such as Wilkinson-Zan to step up and perform, as there are four men and three women on the team who will graduate at the end of the season.\u201cHopefully, (Wilkinson-Zan) will be leading the team,\u201d Mamen says.Wilkinson-Zan could be a \u201ccrucial asset\u201d for developing the team in the future, says graduating skier Kyle Power. Going into OUAs, he\u2019s Carleton\u2019s fastest skier, Power says.\u201cIt\u2019s important for (him) and the other first-year skiers to stay involved with the team,\u201d Power says. \u201cIn the end, fast ski teams attract fast skiers.\u201dLong-term, Wilkinson-Zan says he has his eyes on the international circuit and, hopefully, the Olympics. His coaches say he could get there if he continues to improve.\u201cHe definitely has the potential,\u201d says Jones. \u201cBut it\u2019s a big country, with lots of people who ski.

Ottawa-area organizations are trying to empower members of the city\u2019s black community to affect positive, long-term change following Black History Month. \r\rWhile the national celebration of black communities in Canada is limited to February each year, the black experience is constantly developing, says Sarah Onyango, spokesperson for Black History Ottawa, a charity that raises awareness about the experience of black Canadians in the nation\u2019s capital. The organization was responsible for the city\u2019s official Black History Month launch on Jan. 26 but promotes events focused on black history all year round. \u201cWhat I like to say is, \u2018I\u2019m black all the time.\u2019 Black history to me is a 365-day event,\u201d she says. In an attempt to encourage black Canadians to improve their communities on an individual level, Black History Ottawa themed this year\u2019s events as \u201cOur Canadian Story: I, too can be a hero!,\u201d says Onyango. February is only designated Black History Month because it includes the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, the American president who ended slavery, and Frederick Douglass, a leader of the abolitionist movement, says Onyango. By using Black History Month to focus on the contributions of\u00a0 ordinary individuals to black history, black Canadians will be able to build a better understanding of their identity, says Onyango. Celebrations have traditionally focused on historical role models from other countries, such as Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States. \u201cWhen you\u2019re busy looking at that person many years ago who\u2019s up on a pedestal, and you look at them as the only people capable of making a difference, you\u2019re not empowering yourself at all,\u201d she says. One event that focused on the Canadian story of black history was the Ottawa Storytellers\u2019 Beyond the Railroad \u2013 Black History in Canada event at the National Arts Centre. Ruthanne Edward and spoken-word artist Greg \u2018Ritallin\u2019 Frankson performed stories of black Canadians throughout the past four centuries, some of which contradict the idea of Canada as purely a haven of freedom, says Caitlyn Paxson, Ottawa Storytellers\u2019 managing artistic director. \u201cThey\u2019re important stories to share all year round,\u201d she says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even necessarily going to be doing it this month (February).\u201d The event fit so well with Black History Month, however, they decided to be part of it, says Paxson. Other events included a celebration of children's stories by black authors to promote literacy and a job fair organized by Jaku Konbit, an organization that aims to help disadvantaged families in the city, many of which are part of Ottawa's black community. A banner raising event at the Ottawa Police Service headquarters was open to the public and was attended by city officials including Mayor Jim Watson.For Jaku Konbit, planning the annual Ujima Job Fair in the first couple weeks of Black History Month attracts public attention to possible employment opportunities available for black youth, says Tayo Olafimihan, operations manager. It also coincides with employers that tend to hire early in the year.\u201cThe job fair is our way of saying, let the youth work; let the youth give back to the community,\u201d he says. \u201cBlack History Month happens in February each year but I think what we\u2019re left with, hopefully, is a year-long awareness of the contributions of black Canadians to the city and our country,\u201d says Sgt.

Operation Come Home launched its newest employment program at the beginning of February to provide local restaurants with skilled workers drawn from the ranks of homeless youth. \r\rThe new program on the centre\u2019s roster is FoodWorks. Lasting 16 weeks, it will provide youth participants with hospitality training and work experience to give them an edge in the local job market. The program is broken up into a six-week training and certification period followed by a 10-week work placement.FoodWorks was born out of the ashes of an earlier program called FoodMatters, which began in 2010 but was forced to stop when its funding ran out. \u00a0Elspeth McKay, Operation Come Home\u2019s executive director, says FoodMatters \u201cwas really, really successful in terms of youth that were interested in the culinary and hospitality sector.\u201dThe interest remained even after FoodMatters ended, so McKay applied for and received an annually renewable Telus Community grant of $15,000 to kick-start FoodWorks.The grant was awarded by the Telus Ottawa Community Board, which, since 2009, has supported the centre with approximately $55,000 for its new programs.Shannon Gorman, Telus\u2019s national director of community affairs, says FoodWorks was chosen because Operation Come Home has proven that \u201cthey\u2019re able to use our donations in a way that really adds value to our community.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0McKay says FoodWorks training prepares graduates for jobs in the hospitality sector.Pieter Van den Weghe, general manager of Beckta Dining & Wine on Nepean Street, says the growth of the restaurant industry in Ottawa is going to make finding skilled workers a challenge. He says FoodWorks is yet another resource \u201cto connect people who are interested in developing their skill set with people who are interested in employing these individuals,\u201d and that this is \u201ca perfect combination.\u201dThe program also addresses the fact that \u201ca lot of at-risk and homeless youth do not have the required skill sets to be able to maintain a job,\u201d McKay says. To remedy this, FoodWorks will provide participants with training in food handling, first aid, Smart Serve and WHMIS, a national information system on how to properly handle hazardous workplace materials.McKay says FoodWorks will produce 16 graduates annually and that each participant is subsidized during both training and work placement. McKay says acceptance into the program is determined largely by how motivated a candidate is and how badly they want to work in the hospitality industry.With each participant being paid for the training, FoodWorks will be dependent on external funding to ensure its existence, much like its predecessor FoodMatters. McKay says there are other sources likely to get on board if the Telus grant is not renewed, such as the Community Foundation of Ottawa.Van den Weghe says businesses can\u2019t forget that \u201cwe are still part of a community. If we can contribute in a positive way to people getting off the streets and finding a home to develop or even discover a passion, it\u2019s a great thing.\u201dThe biggest obstacle now facing FoodWorks is getting the work placements set up. McKay says Grounded Kitchen & Coffeehouse on Gloucester Street has already committed to taking on one of the graduates. She says the youth and staff have spoken with other potential employers and are hoping to have the placements locked in and ready to go by March 11.\u00a0\u00a0 ",

    "body": "Caring about the environment has become a movement popular beyond hippie and vegan businesses. Now businesses everywhere want to appear environmentally friendly, with green products, recycling initiatives and charities. \r\rCoca-Cola commercials feature its donations to save the Arctic ecosystem. McDonald\u2019s dedicates part of its website to show off its environmental efforts. Walmart is hosting a competition for students to pitch their ideas to improve business sustainability efforts.Ottawa\u2019s Taylor Schaefer is a top-five finalist in the Walmart Green Student Challenge, but says businesses in general are not doing enough for the environment. \u201cIt costs money initially to make environmental changes and products for the changes can be expensive because a lot of them are new,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of businesses don\u2019t even believe there is a payoff because there\u2019s usually a bit of an upfront cost. Some companies just don\u2019t have the capital to invest and others just choose not to do it.\u201dSchaefer attends Carleton University, where he studies conservation and sustainability engineering, a program in that started at the university last year. New environmental programs have been popping up at universities across the country over the past few years due to the ever-increasing focus on sustainability. He and two friends entered the Walmart challenge with a pitch to encourage businesses to compost. Schaefer says their pitch is to have the big-box retailer partner with businesses by covering 30 per cent of the cost of a $120,000 composting machine. The fertilizer created would be picked up, packaged and sold back to consumers at Walmart. Schaefer says he hopes the initiative would begin with local businesses in Ottawa, then spread nationally. The winner will be chosen by leaders of companies in Canada following presentations by the five finalist groups on Feb. 26. However, even if Schaefer\u2019s team wins first place, they win a cash prize, but no promise that their idea will be implemented.Contests and initiatives like this one do encourage green thinking, but do not have to promise or show any actual changes. This falls in line with greenwashing, a form of marketing that deceptively promotes a company or product as environmentally-friendly. A 2012 American Ipsos study reported that 46 per cent of respondents said they are more inclined to buy a product if it is environmentally friendly. Schaefer says he would expect the same result in Canada. Schaefer says it is time for businesses to make real green changes. \u201cThat\u2019s the hard part, though. Convincing them to actually do it instead of just saying you\u2019re green when you\u2019re not.\u201dCEOs are aware that people are more likely to shop at eco-friendly stores and companies want this business without committing to additional costs. In September 2012, CBC television\u2019s Marketplace investigated environmental claims and found the 10 worst household products for greenwashing. For example, Dawn antibacterial dish soap, whose promotions promise that Dawn saves wildlife by donating this soap to clean animals after oil spills, in fact contains triclosan, an ingredient toxic to animals. The issue is the lack of accountability. A company can claim to be doing great things for the environment without coming under too much scrutiny. If companies can achieve the same financial success simply by saying they\u2019re environmentally friendly, then what incentive is there to actually be environmentally friendly?Consumers who care about the environment and businesses that actually follow through with green promises and initiatives should push for standards for calling products \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cnatural.\u201d While there are some consumer watchdogs, such as Marketplace, businesses can often get away with empty environmental promises. Until there is a strict system to ensure companies fulfill their green promises, consumers cannot expect them to be forthcoming about their actual environmental impact. Greenwashing takes advantage of well-meaning consumers. Standards on claims that a product is eco-friendly must be put into place to stop greenwashing. ",

The quirky name is derived from the brew\u2019s key ingredient: bacon. The company website describes the stout as a \u201csmooth, dark beer\u201d which has the \u201cperfect finish hinting of the fine swine contained within.\u201d For HogsBack co-owner Paige Cutland, the addition of pork to a pint seemed natural.\u201cWith a name like HogsBack, we were wondering if there was anything we could do that was pig related,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWith bacon being so on trend and popular these days, I searched to see if there was any sort of way to flavour beer using it. I found lots of examples of bacon beer that had been made in the United States and figured it could work here.\u201dThe beer has already made news in the United States, as well as England and Finland. It was produced in conjunction with fellow Ottawa brewers Broadhead Brewing Company, which supplied the necessary beer making machinery. Opened in 2010, HogsBack Brewing Company was created by Cutland and three like-minded friends who were inspired to start a brewery after attending a trade show in Orlando, Fla. The company has won awards for its flagship lager, while also producing four seasonal beers each year. In the last few years, the city has seen a surge in popularity of craft brews, with many smaller companies getting their product on tap alongside larger brewing corporations.More than 13 kilograms of bacon was needed to flavour each 780-litre batch of beer. To meet their pork requirements, Cutland and his three other co-owners sought the services of Pork of Yore pig farm. Located 100km west of Ottawa, the farm produces pork products from pasture-raised hogs.Public reaction was positive at the beer\u2019s launch party, and Cutland says he received many compliments on the beer\u2019s taste.\u201cTrying it was a very unique moment,\u201d said craft beer enthusiast Brian Molerio in an email. \u201cIt was only the second bacon beer I had ever heard of and the first I\u2019ve tried. The warmer the beer became, the more bacon flavour came out of it.\u201dAdded launch attendee Galen Wright: \u201cI myself thought it was really really good. It was a classic, dark stout with just a hint of bitterness. I had about five pints if that serves as any indication of the quality.\u201dCutland says HogsBack is looking to build a brewery in Ottawa.",

A new centre located at Carleton University is helping businesses around Ottawa make educated decisions based on facts, math and statistics.\r\rThe Centre for Quantitative Analysis and Decision Support opened last month and is offering Carleton mathematicians and science staff for hire to help businesses analyze and compare data in order to avoid leaving big decisions to chance.\u201cOften a company will base strategic decisions on a gut feeling and experience of course, but we help the client analyze their current situation based on their own data, and sometimes come up with answers to questions they didn\u2019t even know they had,\u201d says Patrick Boily, the centre\u2019s managing consultant.He explains that the centre is hoping to be the interpreters between mathematicians and businesses.\u201cBasically, you have to learn a completely new language to understand mathematics. So we analyze the data, being either records or reports or whatever the company can provide, and we give the client answers in a language they can understand,\u201d says Boily.One of the organizations that already used the services provided by the centre is the United Way.Paul Totten, national director of business and technology solutions for the United Way, says the rapidness and capability of the centre was one of the keys to hiring them.\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of building a 10-year strategic direction for the United Way movement in Canada and our deadline was very short. We were very happy that the centre could help us.\u201dTotten explains they hired the centre to study fundraising data from 112 United Way organizations from across the country for the period of 2003 to 2011 to help identify trends and major motivating factors for fundraising in Canada.\u201cIt is much more than plotting things on a graph, this is actually running statistical formulas and tests against the data to really prove where the changes are. We don\u2019t have the skillset to do that ourselves,\u201d Totten says.Detecting the underlying trend in a dataset is an important part of what the centre can help businesses with, Boily explains.\u201cI\u2019m a mathematician so I like to see math used for good. Here at Carleton we can actually help people with everyday problems instead of just using textbook examples.\u201dThe centre\u2019s fees depend on the size of the project. A joint initiative of the Faculty of Science and the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Carleton University, the centre has access to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.\u201cWe want to provide (the students) with experience so they can one day go out into the real world and say they have a degree in mathematics or statistics but also have experience with solving real world problems,\u201d says Boily.\u00a0",

It is not something that I am happy with, but we will try to get a team of volunteers ready for 2013 so that we can have our normal set of work sessions.\u201dA week later, a second post indicated that work sessions were, in fact, continuing. However, Lisgar principal David McMahon told Centretown News in a Feb. 14 email message that the 2013 mission \u201cis currently postponed.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe are patiently waiting to see if things will change in the labour front and remain optimistic that there will be a space mission this year.\u201dSpacesim runs a variety of educational programs, such as \u201cplanetarium presentations\u201d that are delivered to elementary and high school students on subjects such as astronomy. The group\u2019s planetarium is an inflatable tent equipped with an interior projector that can replicate any constellation in the northern hemisphere.However, the main part of the program is the simulated space mission Lisgar students carry out, and which has attracted considerable attention over the years.Using facilities and equipment at the Ottawa Technical High School on Albert Street, the students actually build a replica interior of a space shuttle and set up a landscape mimicking the planet they\u2019ve chosen to explore.Stefan De Young is an alumnus of Spacesim, and he says the simulation is similar to role-playing games such as \u2018Dungeons and Dragons\u2019 and is all about embracing the fantasy of the experience while learning about space travel.He said that during the missions, certain students take the role of \"simulators\" and act as \"dungeon masters\" by actively recreating the experience for their peers.\u201cIf we\u2019re struck by a little meteorite and it takes out the engines, (the simulators) are able to go into our software and disable the engines,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, they dispatch someone to actually knock a hole through the wall (of the space shuttle replica) with a hammer.\u201dTo make things even more realistic, De Young says students who take the role of the astronauts during the simulation will actually stay inside the model space shuttle overnight for up to five days.Every effort is made to ensure the missions are as convincing as possible, and students learn valuable skills along the way.Grade 10 \u201cSimmie\u201d Patrick Melanson, the deputy mission commander of the postponed 2013 mission, says the program has taught him a variety of skills.\u201cI\u2018m currently working on rewriting the spaceflight simulation software\u2026and am learning plenty about programming, physics, and simulation techniques all at the same time,\u201d he said in an email.For De Young, his involvement in Spacesim was about more than just the educational side.Spacesim \u201cgave me a place to be, it gave me people to interact with, people who shared my interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very welcoming environment for me and I appreciated that.\u201dIt also helped him figure out his professional aspirations. De Young went on to study astrophysics at the University of Waterloo and is now working on his graduate degree in aerospace engineering at Carleton University.\u201cSpacesim really confirmed for me,\u201d he said, that \u201cI wanted to be involved in some way in space exploration \u2013 being an astronaut would be the ideal.\u201dSimmies are anxiously awaiting the verdict on whether this year\u2019s mission will be relaunched, while also preparing \u2013 ironically given the postponement \u2013 for the program's 25th anniversary celebration, tentatively scheduled for June 29.",

Students of St. Anthony Catholic School on Booth Street are working to get their EcoSchool certification as part of an Ontario-wide program to encourage environmentally friendly activities among young people. \r\rWith the help of teachers and staff, a group of pupils have formed an extracurricular club, called the green team, aimed at conserving energy and keeping the school clean.Teresa Rupnik, a teacher at the school who is part of the team, says members of the green team include 15 pupils, the principal, three teachers and an educational assistant. Rupnik says the children who showed interest were recruited to be on the team. \u00a0Despite being a small group, these students \u201care the ones showing leadership for the entire school,\u201d says Rupnik.\u00a0 \u00a0Rupnik says these pupils have promoted their green lifestyle to other students. \u201cI can\u2019t go outside for three consecutive recesses without being asked to pick up garbage,\u201d says Brian Kelly, principal at St. Anthony.\u00a0Kelly says it has been a very successful experience so far.The Ottawa Catholic School Board decided to encourage this EcoSchool certification five years ago but it\u2019s up to individuals school to decide whether they want to get involved in it or not, says Kelly.

This survey helps us put our finger right on the pulse of the community.\u201d Gagne says the five-question survey was the BIA\u2019s first foray into online polling and will hopefully reach people who were uncomfortable with answering volunteers with clipboards on the street conducting similar surveys last October and November. Although he says the questions were simple, such as \u201cWhat would you like to see on Sparks Street?\u201d they were all open-ended, leaving a lot of room for suggestions and further discussion. Other questions included: \u201cWhat draws you to Sparks Street?\u201d, \u201cAre there some aspects of the street you find unappealing?\u201d and \u201cIf there is one thing that could be done to improve your Sparks Street experience, what should it be?\u201d.\u201cThe overall reaction to the survey was really good. Unfortunately, we won\u2019t know the exact results until mid-March when we have our board strategic planning session. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll be able to talk through the results of this survey and our broader action plan\u201d he says.The BIA\u2019s action plan, of which this latest survey is a part, is an all-encompassing endeavour aiming to both improve and reinvent the street, says Gagne. It touches on issues ranging from gap analysis, which assesses where retail is lacking and needs to be filled in, to infrastructure improvement, such as repaving the street with interlocking stones that better withstand harsh winters. Mike Dufresne, a Centretown resident who answered the survey, says he\u2019s pleased with the willingness to hear from community members. \u201cI don\u2019t want people who are in charge of making decisions that affect me, make them by guessing. I want to see them put in the effort to get to know what I want before they act,\u201d he says.Dufresne says the biggest improvement he wants to see is a livelier night-time experience. \u201cI don\u2019t mean clubs but I\u2019d love to see special events being held on a more regular basis. After the stores close the street gets pretty dead. If there\u2019s something else that attracts people after that time though, the street can stay busy and fun.\u201d Gagne, who took over as executive director of the BIA in June, says he hopes \u2013 and expects \u2013 to get answers to questions like Dufresne\u2019s when the results are analyzed.\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get people more involved with the street,\u201d he says, \u201cand one of the ways we\u2019ve had success with is through third party collaborations on events such as WinterBrewed that starts soon. It\u2019s not our event but we have a partnership that will hopefully attract a lot of people.\u201d Another issue Gagne predicts he\u2019ll encounter is making the street cyclist friendly. As things stand, cycling is not permitted on Sparks Street. Cyclists have to walk their bikes or take another street. This can be frustrating for avid cyclists such as Erica Stevens who says most cyclists would love to take an easy ride through the street to enjoy the atmosphere without having to dismount.\u201cMost of us don\u2019t want to go speeding through the street, otherwise we\u2019d take another one. We want to go and enjoy it the way we go and enjoy other areas of town, by pedalling through them,\u201d she says.These, and other such issues, are something Gagne says he and the BIA want to pursue. He says it\u2019s not a revitalisation they want to undertake, but rather a complete reinvention, taking the old iconic street and making it new.\u201cWith the help of the community,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019re well on our way.\u201d ",

A harsh mix of wind and rain is enough to keep most people indoors, but not Slava Slesarenko. Wrapped in his bright yellow robe, he stands outside the Moulin de Provence Bakery in the Byward Market with his eyes closed.\r\rNow and then, someone adds to the black bowl cupped in Slesarenko\u2019s hands \u2013 a handful of change or a box of chocolates. After each contribution, Slesarenko turns to his benefactor and bows deeply with a smile.Meditating with his alms bowl in hand is just one of the practices Slesarenko adopted over the last 23 years, ever since he dedicated his life to Buddhist monkhood. His conspicuous post on bustling street corners is meant to draw attention. Every day, after his morning prayers, he walks through the downtown core, starting at his home at O\u2019Connor and Lisgar. Rain or shine, Slesarenko says he continues his street practice, sometimes beating a drum, so people know there is a monk in the city. \u201cIt raises the thought in human mind that there\u2019s something else available,\u201d he says.His own search for something else led Slesarenko to leave his hometown of Sevastopol, the second largest port in Ukraine, in 1989. He was 19 with 15 years of cadet schooling. The Soviet Union was at war and Slesarenko was expected to serve in Afghanistan with the navy.He had not heard of Buddhism, but Slesarenko says he already considered himself \u201ca peaceful person. I did not want to go to war, simple like that.\".Soviet military service, however, was not voluntary. To convince the government he was unfit to serve, Slesarenko turned to self-injury. He ended up in intensive care, suffering from severe blood loss, and was relieved from duty three months later.The incident was a turning point for Slesarenko. \u201cI always believe in, you know, something more beautiful and important we can do with our lives than just exist,\u201d he says. When he recovered, Slesarenko divorced his wife, quit his job and took his paycheque to the airport. \u201cI just left,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew something was wrong.\u201dSlesarenko booked the first flight he could afford out of Ukraine and landed in Kazakhstan. With the rest of his money, he bought a bus ticket into the mountains of Afghanistan.For three months during avalanche season, he survived alone \u2013 mainly on wild strawberries \u2013\u00a0before ice climbers found him and took him to their camp. He spent a month there before deciding to return to the Soviet Union. \u00a0He went to Russia and took a train to St. Petersburg. On the way, a note in the newspaper caught Slesarenko\u2019s eye. Buddhist lamas from Mongolia were teaching at a local temple. Slesarenko had never set foot in a temple before. When he walked in, however, he found what he had been looking for.\u201cOnce I come in the main hall, I look at the altar and I smell the incense, and it was so calm and quiet . . . and I just felt I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere else,\u201d Slesarenko says. \u201cI want to stay as I am right here.\u201dSlesarenko began volunteering at the temple and soon caught the attention of the head of the monastery. He studied there for three years as the first Slavic monk until Junsei Terasawa, a Japanese Buddhist monk, recruited him as a student. Under his guidance, Slesarenko organized Buddhist communities in Russia and Ukraine. By 1999, however, Slesarenko was looking for a new challenge. He came to Canada, where he said he had to \u201cstart from zero.\u201d After 14 years in the city, Slesarenko says he sees a hunger for community in Ottawa, where everyone suffers alone with constant stress. \u201cPeople have hundreds of friends on the Facebook,\u201d he says, \u201cbut at the same time, they don\u2019t have nobody to just sit and chat when they\u2019re in trouble.\u201dTo fill that void, Slesarenko engages the community beyond his street practice. Since January, he has opened his home at 11-226 O\u2019Connor St. for daily public prayer sessions at 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Attendance is sporadic, but Slesarenko says he is content to pray, even when alone.\u201cI just do my practice and try to show people instead of teaching them,\u201d he says, \u201cjust show by my own example that it is possible to be happy.\u201d",

The health centre plans to do this by handing out specialized forms for residents to fill out and keep, each tailored to a particular type of development. In this way, residents can arm ttemselves with appropriate and relevant questions for development in their area, to come up with their own answers, says Christina Marchant, director of community health promotion at CCHC.\u201cHealth isn\u2019t just a matter of biological considerations, says David Hole, former executive director at South-East Ottawa Community Health Centre. \u201cIt\u2019s whether or not you\u2019re able to eat right, be active, be social, work at a reasonable distance from home, manage a relatively stress-free life.\u201dThe health centre will not be collecting or aggregating the data in any way, Marchant says. The hope is residents who fill out the forms will refer to them in community meetings, or be encouraged to have serious discussions about nearby development with their neighbours. \u201cEngaged communities are healthier communities,\u201d Marchant says. For example, the CHCC form for small housing developments asks whether or not the project will create more affordable housing in the area or add trees or vegetation. The form provided for large commercial developments asks questions such as whether or not the development will increase traffic in the area, or create improved public space such as courtyards. The forms were put together over a period of months with the help of a range of community associations from Centretown, Hintonburg, Dalhousie and the Glebe, as well as Ottawa Public Health.

The missing portraits were noticed by David McMahon, Lisgar\u2019s current principal, after renovations were completed on the library last year and staff went to re-hang the gallery of Lisgar educators. \u201cThe school library for many years had quite a gallery of portraits, mostly of past principals and headmasters, as well as a number of outstanding teachers,\u201d says McMahon. \u201cIt was natural to wonder whether we could make the roll complete.\u201dOriginally, the school counted five missing principals. The alumni association was able to turn up three of the five.But still missing are the portraits of Robb, who served between 1845 and 1850, and Millar, who held the post from 1856 to 1858.\u201cIn order to recognize their years at Lisgar, bronze plates have been mounted and it is hoped someone may be able to provide a picture at a later time,\u201d the latest alumni newsletter notes. \u201cPerhaps an enterprising alumnus would like to mount a search.\u201dIn the past, the association and its predecessor group of ex-pupils had received donations of pictures and portraits of past Lisgar notables, and have copied other pictures from newsletters or yearbooks dating back to the 1880s.

    "body": "ImageConst. Khoa N. HoangI have often wondered how much television has affected my life, from the  products I buy to the movies that I watch because of particular actors.  We are not always aware of subconscious influences that consistently  affect our decision making.\r\rFurthermore, the relationship with our television is a personal one, intimate and exciting.\u00a0 But is it healthy? Like many relationships we remember the good and ignore the bad. We see that it brings people together for events while forgetting that it makes us fat while sitting there inactive. Television gives us cognitive stimulus but limits the need to cognitively think.TV trends are both an influence and an indicator of our society and can even reflect an important issue of a particular decade. Even the commercials that play within each decade are a symbol of consumer priority. We can no longer deny the influence of media on our decision-making ability and must recognize the actual limits of our own choices.The average American watches five hours of television each day and the average Canadian watches four hours daily. Although most of the television watching occurs on the weekend, that still adds up to 33 hours every week for the average Canadian to sit in front of their televisions.Every generation has television trends that influence watchers of that period.\u00a0 Television in the 1980s meant being exposed to influences involving family dynamics like Full House, Family Ties, and the Cosby Show.\u00a0 The \u201990s brought us an influx of comedy shows targeting a younger audience such as Fresh Prince, Friends, and Seinfeld.By 2000, television gave us our first taste of reality TV with Survivor Island.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t long until reality TV started asking what we thought. American Idol Season 1 aired in the summer of 2002, and launched the current trend we have today of judgment television shows. It was quickly followed by dancing, singing, and more talent for us all to judge.Producers can now make money on advertisement and voting fees within the same show, without having to pay for any real actors. The formula seems perfect creating a successful business that provides millions of dollars in revenue. My concern is the common practice of providing judgment by a generation of Millennials (the title given to those born after 1981) who have already been labeled as being more interested in themselves than community, preferring fame over self-esteem, according to the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.Our society is changing and therefore the definition of happiness is changing. We need to recognize that happiness is now individually defined and not a society norm of morals and values as it once was. Marriage at 18 is now frowned upon and having more than four kids seems like a nightmare to most; unlike the days of my grandparents who married at 16 and had 10 kids.We need more conversations about parenting to learn how to build capacity for ourselves and future generations. For now, perhaps turning off the television and reading a simple article will have to do.",

Kelly\u2019s version of British playwright Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s Absurd Person Singular seems to refine that famous line. Here, hell is five other people forced to make banter at an annual Christmas party.\r\rBut while that definition is narrower than Sartre\u2019s, the material in Seven Thirty Productions\u2019 opening night performance at the Gladstone Theatre went for the big and the broad. Divided into three acts, the comedy takes place between 1972 and 1974. It focuses on three couples as they take turns opening their homes to one another on Christmas. Jane and Sidney Hopcroft (played by Melanie Karin and Stewart Matthews, respectively) lead off as the first hosts, young and eager to impress their guests. They\u2019re followed by the depressed Eva Jackson (Michelle LeBlanc) and her unfaithful husband Geoffrey (David Whiteley), and then by the aristocratically dull Ronald Brewster-Wright (Tom Charlebois) and his often-drunk wife, Marion (Lori Jean Hodge).\u00a0Absurd Person Singular\u00a0Director: John P. KellyCast: Melanie Karin, Stewart Matthews, Tom Charlebois, Lori Jean Hodge, Michelle LeBlanc, David Whiteley.As each act goes on, the cracks in each couple\u2019s relationship begin to show, leading to suicide attempts, electrocutions, dog attacks and a surreally sinister game of musical dancing. Hardly holly-jolly stuff.So it\u2019s good that the cast clearly seemed to be enjoying themselves. The play was frequently at its best with as many actors onstage as possible. The second act proved especially memorable. With five of the six cast members packed into one kitchen, each player seemed to work individually, and yet everything came together like an elaborately choreographed whole. Individually, each performer brought their own distinct elements to the characters. The Hopcrofts, especially, made for the most energetic pair of the night. Both Karin and Matthews zipped around the stage, easily conveying their characters\u2019 anxiety in the early parts of the play before becoming more and more self-assured. Karin proved extremely versatile, imbuing Jane\u2019s voice with a cheery trill that managed to somehow stay winning despite a somewhat grating cockney accent. Frequently put upon in the first act, she rose to the occasion, clearly showing the strains of a housewife under pressure to impress her husband\u2019s colleagues before finally resigning to sad defeat.Matthews, meanwhile, shifted facial expressions expertly while striding about in big, sweeping motions. He effectively conveyed Sidney\u2019s desperate need for acceptance from people he sees as above him. Indeed, the fact that both characters became a bit tiresome by the third act may be a sign that the two were even a bit too effective. When they were onstage, it sometimes became a bit hard to focus on the older characters.As Eva, LeBlanc managed to wring humour from a woman completely worn down by her husband\u2019s infidelity and her own mental illness. Her facial expressions made her character\u2019s attempts to strangle herself with a laundry line go from pathetically, hopelessly sad to laughable and back again. Whiteley, also the set designer and the Gladstone\u2019s season coordinator, made for a perfect straight man, playing Geoffrey as a self-absorbed cad too wrapped up in his own affairs to notice his wife trying to kill herself.Hodge and Charlebois, meanwhile, acted as the more restrained of the couples. While each character still had their flaws, they didn\u2019t demand the spotlight or make the play feel too crowded, instead shading in the background with some of the play\u2019s slyest gags.While Absurd Person Singular\u2019s title references the individual, Seven Thirty\u2019s production succeeded overall because its actors could work so well as a group.Absurd Person Singular runs from March 6-23, 2013 at the Gladstone Theatre.",

The verdict means the 39-year-old Marti will not face deportation, as his wife and four children did.

According to a statement of facts presented during the hearing, Marti, who is a specialized Calabrese baker, had obtained a work permit in January 2011 to work at De Santino Ristorante.Soon after, he became co-owner of Little Italy Bakery on Preston Street. But when his work permit expired in December 2011 and his application for a renewal was denied on June 19, 2012, because it was sent to the wrong place, Marti found himself without a permit but with a business that still needed to run.In a small bakery that had trouble with employee turnover, it was not uncommon, according to Canada Boarder Services Agency, to see Marti baking, serving customers and even going on delivery runs to pick up the slack. The activities were considered to be an infraction of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. According to the act, an activity may be considered work if wages are earned or if it is in direct competition with Canadian citizens or permanent residents seeking to do the same activity. Dumoulin explained that because Marti had not been earning a salary since his permit had expired, his case hinged on the second aspect of the definition.

People think that we live beside a big river and see that water has been fairly cheap in the past,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cIt will be a benefit in the long term because people won\u2019t be wasting water.\u201dCentretown Citizens Ottawa Corp., the neighbourhood\u2019s main social housing agency, agrees, says Meg McCallum, the group\u2019s membership and communications manager. She says paying more money for water will be worthwhile because \u201cfrom a sustainability perspective, it makes a lot of sense.\u201dThe group is planning to install low-flow toilets in most of its 1,500 units throughout the city in order to deal with the increase. McCallum says the move will help offset rising water costs and allow the group to fulfill its mandate of providing affordable housing while making the community more environmentally friendly.She says that, while it may not be easy for some, other businesses in Centretown will have to make similar changes if they want to continue to thrive with rising costs.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of tightening the belt of the budget, achieving cost savings over time and changing some of the business models,\u201d McCallum says. However, some people in the community don\u2019t share her point of view.Jo-Ann Laverty, co-owner of The Red Apron bakery on Gladstone Avenue, says there is nothing her business can do to cut down its use of water and that it will be negatively impacted as water rates continue to climb over the next decade.\u201cWe are a production kitchen,\u201d Laverty says. \u201cWe go through a significant amount of water. Our dishwasher is going eight hours a day. It would impact us.\u201dCentretown Citizens Community Association vice-president Rob Dekker echoes those sentiments.Dekker says the rising cost of water will have a greater impact on Centretown than other areas of the city because a majority of residents and businesses in the neighbourhood are already dealing with a high cost of living and have seen property taxes increase substantially in recent years.He says low-income residents \u2014 particularly those who rent \u2014 will be most susceptible to the change. \u201cWe know salaries are not keeping up (with costs) and that there is going to be a bubble that bursts,\u201d Dekker says. While the increase may stretch the budgets of some, Holmes says that certain infrastructure work needs to be done.

    "body": "A travelling magician with an underdeveloped conscience and a penchant for deceit in his seductions as well as in his stage performances, Oscar \u201cOz\u201d Diggs (James Franco) is not an overly likeable fellow. When an old flame named Annie (Michelle Williams) arrives after an abortive magic act to tell him another man has proposed to her, his response is ambiguous, and she ends up reassuring Oscar that he is a good man.\r\r\u201cKansas is full of good men,\u201d he replies, invoking the spectacular accomplishments of Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison. \u201cI want to be a great one.\u201dThey are promptly interrupted by a furious circus strongman whose wife Oscar lately put the moves on. One convenient hot air balloon and one unexpected tornado later, Oscar has escaped the black-and-white, 4:3 confines of turn-of-the-century Kansas to a lush, vividly colourful, wide-screen showcase of Avatar-like world-building, which is to say Oz, where Oscar will have the chance to test his mettle against the demands of greatness.Encountering a talking winged monkey (voiced by Zach Braff, who appears as Oscar\u2019s harried assistant in Kansas), a diminutive china girl, and a kindly, beautiful Good Witch named Theodora (Mila Kunis) who falls for him, Oscar is mistaken \u2013 because of his nickname and his handy bag of tricks \u2013 for a powerful, genuine wizard prophesied to save the land from the malevolent Wicked Witch.\u00a0Oz the Great and PowerfulDirected by Sam Raimi.Starring James Franco, Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, Zach Braff, Bill Cobbs.But in Emerald City, Theodora\u2019s sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) doubts Oscar\u2019s legitimacy. Then, after meeting the third beautiful witch sister, Glinda (Michelle Williams), Oscar discovers he is not the only lying manipulator in Oz and has to sort out the good from the wicked while preparing to defeat an occupying army and restore the land to its former glory. Although Sam Raimi\u2019s oddball sensibilities still generate arresting moments, including a brief scene in which our heroes teeter in silhouette at the edge of a precipice like a cluster of shadow-puppets, the director seems to have completed his own journey from creative maverick to mainstream standard-bearer.In general, it\u2019s all too sadly familiar, from the endless panoply of picture-perfect waterfalls and responsive flora \u2013 which one-up James Cameron\u2019s Pandora on a scale of saccharinity \u2013 to the hillocks that collapse just as our heroes run over them, from sorcerous finger-lightning to wand duels.Everything is a retread, and not even from The Wizard of Oz, which would make the derivative quality more palatable (though abundant hints do sketch the origins of characters from the Judy Garland film), but rather from the shallow, tepid soup of popular culture \u2013 and this despite a wealth of princesses, Munchkins, Nomes, Whimsies and Phanfasms in the 14 Oz books by L. Frank Baum, where magic tended to be a bit more interesting than just furious fireballs one after another.Oz the Great and Powerful plays fast and loose with the conventions of Oz, of good versus evil, and of witches, all in service to a generic, PG-rated, CG-warfare adventure.The whole concept is in essence a cop-out: in The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy fell ambiguously asleep and dreamed of variations on people she knew, whom she came to miss and appreciate all the more in the land of Oz. The self-styled wizard of this prequel, preceding her and being needed in Oz for Dorothy\u2019s eventual arrival, can make no such exit, and so the pay-off is restricted to what can occur within the fantasy, which seems almost self-defeating. Should Oscar not naturally return to Kansas to court Annie at some point?Between the period setting, his own redemptive arc as protagonist, and the whole fantastical setting (underpinned by the need to interact with other characters who don\u2019t exist before post-production), James Franco has a lot on his plate. Considering how difficult it is to like the character as written for most of the story, he fairs reasonably well, though with his uneven accent, he seems out of his league opposite the trio of high-profile actresses \u2013 at least until green witch make-up instantly reduces an A-lister to something that could barely pass for a cheap caricature.Finley the flying monkey plays comic relief well enough but the humour is distinctly modern and consequently at odds with the realm and nature of Oz.Ultimately, this is Oz the way Tim Burton\u2019s 2010 monstrosity was Wonderland: a CGI-infested emotional flatland capped off with generic battles and duels, jammed full of references to an original work the nostalgia for which deserves better. In both cases, set decoration and whiz-bang effects seem to have been prioritized above writing and direction.About as brainy as the Scarecrow and with as much heart as the Tin Man \u2013 in both cases, before they met Dorothy \u2013 Raimi\u2019s Oz is neither great nor powerful. You are better off renting Stardust.",

The Good Companions is the first seniors\u2019 organization targeted by the partnership, which received $130,000 to be spread out over three years from the United Way.The most recent initiative at The Good Companions focuses on home care for LGBT seniors. The centre has recruited nearly a dozen LGBT volunteers to work with LGBT seniors living in their own homes. It\u2019s an important aspect of assuring these seniors get the help they need, Marchant says.\u201cWe hear many stories of how queer seniors in their homes will be reluctant to ask for help because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll be discriminated against,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid that they\u2019ll be judged for being gay or lesbian or trans.\u201dCreating an LGBT-inclusive environment requires a complete review of nearly all organizational policies and practices, Marchant says.\u201cYou need to look at all levels of your organization,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look at your board actions, your board governance work. You look at how you communicate, with whom we communicate out there, and we look at what kind of programs we offer.\u201dStaff and volunteers at the Good Companions have both received LGBT awareness training, Marchant says. Most of the training has been carried out by members of the Senior Pride Network, a group of community members, service providers and activists working to make Ottawa a more inclusive place for LGBT seniors.\u201cThey\u2019re mostly retired, LGBT seniors themselves,\u201d Marchant says. \u201cThey bring great training experiences and also lived experiences.\u201dThe Good Companions has also changed its intake forms to allow volunteers and members to indicate whether they identify as LGBT, Marchant says.\u201cAt the end of March, they\u2019ll be able to run stats and find for the first time how many people identify as LGBT and then they\u2019ll be able to track over time how that changes,\u201d she says.Robertson says she will finish out the year developing programs and training at the Good Companions before moving onto different seniors\u2019 centres in Ottawa for the next two years. The Senior Pride Network won a community builders award from the United Way last year, which provided funding for the partnership, she says.Marchant cannot confirm where the Centretown health centre will be focusing its LGBT awareness efforts in the coming years, but said it\u2019s definitely speaking to a need in the community. They\u2019ve already done training with workers at the Beechwood Cemetery, the Old Forge Seniors Support Service and with all the member organizations of the Ottawa Community Support Coalition.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an appetite out there among seniors organizations to dive into this a bit more,\u201d she says.",

    "body": "The City of Ottawa\u2019s plan to reinstate full fees for restaurant patios after a two-year, low-fee pilot project along Preston Street sparked criticism from a leading voice for Centretown businesses.\r\rLori Mellor, executive director of the Preston Street BIA, has urged the city to reconsider the planned restoration of full patio fees, arguing that reduced rates do promote the creation and retention of outdoor restaurant spaces and help enliven retail areas.\u201cThe City of Hamilton has recently completely waived patio fees,\u201d says Mellor.\u201cTheir justification for this step was that patios attract tourists to the city, create a more vibrant downtown and their own police force supports patios because they put people in the downtown, putting eyes on the street which discourages crime.\u201d The pilot project started in May 2011. According to a staff report recently submitted to city councillors, \u201cPreston Street BIA argued that a reduction in the fee would increase the opportunities for new patios animating the recently reconstructed street.\u201d To test the theory, the city reduced the daily fees for patios \u2014 only on Preston Street \u2014 by 43 per cent. According to the report, patio owners normally pay the city $1.31 per square metre for every day that outdoor seating is available for customers, weather permitting.During the pilot project, those fees were reduced for the patios in Little Italy to 55 cents per square metre per day.When the committee approved the project in 2010, its success was to be measured by \u201cthe amount of new growth in the number of patios and the retention of the existing patios,\u201d according to the report. But after assessing the results of the rate reduction, city staff concluded that the lowered fee didn\u2019t really have much of an effect on promoting new patios in the area, with Little Italy experiencing no more patio construction activity than other parts of the city where the full fee was maintained.During the pilot project, La Roma Restaurant opened a patio and Stoneface Dolly\u2019s Restaurant chose to keep its patio open \u2014 something its owners indicated they wouldn\u2019t have done if the usual, higher fee had been kept in place, says Mellor.The reduced fee definitely encouraged La Roma to open its patio, says Maria Papalia, the restaurant\u2019s owner.However, the report indicated that about $51,000 worth of patio fees were sacrificed by the city to undertake the low-fee pilot project on Preston Street and recommended that the fee be reset to the $1.31 rate for this summer.\u201cPatios improve the general attractiveness of a main street,\u201d Mellor says, adding that they also increase general spending. Patrons who use patios tend to spend more at restaurants and more in the surrounding area, she says. Mellor says she and other BIA directors in the city are still lobbying to reduce patio fees permanently. \u201cThe downtown BIAs propose that the patio rate be set at 75 cents per square metre per day,\u201d she says. \u201cThis rate still generates revenue for the city, but at a price that will not create disincentives for patio owners to open.\u201d",

    "body": "Kayla Redstone, Centretown NewsHooley's Pub has requested permission to create a sidewalk patio facing Elgin Street. An application by Hooley's Pub to build a sidewalk patio on Elgin Street is in the hands of the community.\r\rThe request could be approved by the city as soon as May if it has to go to the transportation committee, says Ermis Durofil, a city program manager overseeing planning and growth management and right of way bylaws. Other Elgin Street pubs such as Woody\u2019s Elgin Street Urban Pub have already received approval for similar patios and while some residents enjoy being able to eat outside, others say losing half the sidewalk space has created some difficulties for pedestrian traffic. On Feb. 25, the city sent out a notice to surrounding businesses and residents regarding the details of the proposed patio and asked for comments. Durofil says the city has already received objections and support.As the pub is close to a residential area the city has asked for comments on the proposal from ward Coun. Diane Holmes and the Centretown Citizens Community Association, Durofil says. Holmes says she\u2019s worried there isn\u2019t enough space for both pedestrians and patios. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the width on Elgin Street and the number of pedestrians on Elgin Street.\u201d While she says she understands patios go wherever there is a lot of foot traffic, city bylaws require the sidewalk to be wider for both the large numbers of pedestrians and the proposed patio. The city has never abided by that policy, Holmes says, and has instead created a new minimum width standard, regardless of the number of pedestrians.The proposed patio would be 16 metres long and 1.5 metres wide seating 32 customers, leaving 1.8 metres of sidewalk space for pedestrians, which is the exact width of the city standard. \u201cThe complaint that we\u2019ve had about the other locations is a worry that the pedestrians might be forced off the sidewalk and into the traffic lane,\u201d Holmes says.Hooley\u2019s Pub is following a recent trend of sidewalk patios on Elgin Street sidewalks. Woody\u2019s Elgin Street Urban Pub sparked the idea last summer and put in the first request to the city, shortly followed by The Standard, both of which were temporarily approved.At first, patios seemed like a good way to reanimate the street, says Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association. However, after they began popping up on Elgin Street, creating pedestrian congestion, he says the association rethought the idea. Holmes says she is recommending the city temporarily approve Hooley\u2019s Pub\u2019s patio request for this spring and summer, and determine if there are any pedestrian concerns during that time. ",

    "body": "One of the least safe parks in the city has the potential to become a gathering place for Centretown residents, according to a report on Dundonald Park.\r\rThe report was released in late February, following a year of observation and public consultation by Toronto group 8-80 Cities and the Centretown Community Health Centre as part of the \u201cMake a Place for People Project.\u201d\u201cWe see Dundonald Park as an underused community gathering space,\u201d says Christina Marchant, a director at the health centre.Named after Douglas Cochrane, the 12th Earl of Dundonald, the park on Somerset Street W. and Lyon Street is rich with history. It was the site of the RCMP\u2019s monitoring of Igor Gouzenko\u2019s neighbouring apartment in the early days of the Cold War.Now, the space has a negative reputation. Located across from a Beer Store, Dundonald Park is notorious among local residents as a venue for drug use and public intoxication. \u201cWe really felt that there was a high need for the project at that park,\u201d says Emily Munroe, a director at 8-80 Cities. \u201cA lot of the community members that we spoke to very clearly indicated that they didn\u2019t perceive the park as safe.\u201dHowever, the report does not suggest measures to discourage people from visiting the park. \u201cFrom our perspective, the park\u2019s a place for everybody,\u201d says Marchant. \u201cIf you think about street-involved people, people in rooming houses, people who may not have a home, the park in a way is their living room,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we have no interest in moving people out of their living room.\u201dInstead, all members of the neighbourhood are encouraged to get involved in the makeover.\u201cAccess to green space for purposes of physical activity is definitely an important contributor to people\u2019s health,\u201d says Marchant. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly evidence that just shows that being in nature is helpful for people\u2019s physical and emotional health,\u201d she says.Rather than an action plan, the report provides ideas to inspire the creation of a community gathering space.An interactive water feature and a children\u2019s garden are two of the report\u2019s suggestions for attracting people to the park during summer months.When the weather gets colder, the report suggests snow-shoeing and cross country ski lessons.These ideas are meant to keep people in the park long enough to enjoy it. The report found that 57 per cent of visitors are walking through the park. The average amount of time spent in the park is four minutes. The report acknowledges there are already efforts being made by residents and local businesses. Centretown Movies transforms Dundonald Park into an outdoor theatre. On summer evenings, visitors watch movies on an outdoor screen. Organizers say similar events signify that park atmosphere is improving.\u201cMy understanding is that the park was not always a family friendly environment,\u201d says Marianne DosSantos, last summer\u2019s co-ordinator for Centretown Movies.\u201cBut the CCHC and Centretown Movies have been working for years to create activities that could interest community members and thereby bring people back to the park.\u201d",

    "body": "\u201cFor four wheels, two wheels or big wheels.\u201d That\u2019s the hope for downtown roads according to Ottawa city planner Nelson Edwards.\r\rOnce the LRT and bus lanes are underground, main streets will be freer for other types of vehicles. But is it right to replace the armies of buses that now crowd downtown\u00a0 roads with more cars and trucks? The Downtown Moves plan wants to make the centre of Ottawa a more walkable and liveable place. City planners want more bike lanes and less street parking, as well as bigger sidewalks and patios along streets like Albert and Slater. For anyone who has ever had to walk through the downtown area during rush hour, most would agree that a more pedestrian-friendly core and wider sidewalks will be a welcome change. However, at the transportation committee meeting last week, many councillors raised issue with the plan, saying that these changes will make driving less convenient. Driving in downtown Ottawa is already inconvenient; spending 20 minutes in traffic to get across the eight blocks from Bronson Avenue to Elgin Street is not how most people like to spend their time. What Ottawa needs are alternatives to driving, whether it is LRT, biking or walking. But it is more than just a transportation issue. Getting rid of the large number of cars in the downtown area could go a long way to rejuvenating the drab business sector.\u00a0 Wider sidewalks would mean more room for pedestrians and make stores and restaurants more accessible. Trees, sitting areas and a decrease in traffic would go a long way to encourage people to linger, shop and eat.\u00a0 Of course, as councillors mentioned at the transportation committee, changes like these don\u2019t come without a large price tag. As the fourth most populated city in Canada, Ottawa\u2019s public transportation infrastructure lags behind the rest. In cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, light rail transit and subways shuttle people from the suburbs to the downtown core every day. Vancouver in particular has greatly expanded its LRT system, building over 70 km of track since 1985 and creating Canada\u2019s first airport link. Twenty years on, its Skytrain now has the eighth highest weekday ridership in North America, according to American Public Transit Association\u2019s Ridership Reports Statistics. Investments like these are worth the money, even if the effects are not seen right away. With the arrival of the LRT system in Ottawa, hopefully the city will move in the same direction. People can leave the cars at home, and reduce the congestion and pollution on streets and highways. While city council\u2019s transportation committee voted unanimously in favour of the Downtown Moves plan last week, the support and funding for the ambitious project are still needed from city council. The plan will mean big changes for Ottawa residents used to a dreary downtown core, but the heart of Ottawa needs a kick-start and that won\u2019t happen without a big shock. ",

If this happened to our non-native Canadian women at the same rate, there would be more than 20,000 victims.\r\rWhile indigenous women and girls account for 10 per cent of all female homicides in Canada, they make up just three per cent of our female population. About 85per cent of all homicides are solved by police investigations, but that \u201cclearance rate\u201d drops to just 50\u00a0 per cent when the victim is an Aboriginal woman or girl. Our indifference towards this injustice must end. That\u2019s why the Liberal party has been pushing for years for a transparent public inquiry to get to the bottom of these cases and their root causes. Yet each time we advanced the idea, we have been rebuffed.Finally, there is a breakthrough: Parliament has passed a Liberal motion with the support of all parties to create a special Parliamentary committee to look into these cases and to find ways to address the root causes of this intolerable violence.While we still firmly believe that a National Public Inquiry is needed, this is a small, but important first step. Now it is up to all MPs to ensure the committee conducts serious work without interference from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. It is high time to provide justice for the victims, healing for their families and an end to the violence.Carolyn Bennett, MPLiberal Party of Canada, Aboriginal Affairs Critic",

    "body": "The kids are all right. And if they\u2019re not, who are we going to blame?\r\rPeople are angry in the wake of the Elementary Teachers\u2019 Federation of Ontario\u2019s decision to uphold its recommendation for elementary school teachers to continue boycotting extracurriculars.And angry people incorrectly point fingers.Recommendation is a term that should be used loosely. Not acting in line with the union\u2019s recommendation could be costly for teachers already worried about salaries: they could face $500-a-day fines and public name shaming.Essentially, their careers and reputations will take a substantial hit.What needs to be understood is that the strike is the result of what teachers claim is the legally questionable Bill 115. Second, the strike is the only means available to the teachers to fight for a new contract since the provincial government has removed their opportunity to bargain without impacting the students.Their ability to strike like other government workers is diminished due to the fact that they are working with children. They are therefore left with limited opportunities to show that the changes enacted by the former McGuinty government are detrimental to their livelihood. The bill calls for a salary freeze, three unpaid PA days (1.5 per cent of their salary), a reduction of annual sick days from 20 to 10 and the loss of all banked sick days.Scott Searle, a teacher at a catholic high school in Ottawa, says although extracurriculars benefit students, they aren\u2019t mandatory activities for the teachers to support.Teachers add on several hours a week in additional activities. There aren\u2019t many other professions in which people spend several hours after work volunteering their time.Yet, parents and commentators alike are quick to take a swing at educators, guffawing at their decision to boycott extracurricular activities as if they do it maliciously to harm children.When sanctions like these are decided by unions and imposed on the teachers, they are once again forcing educators to deal with decisions made by others while receiving the brunt of the public criticism.It is unfortunate for both students and\u00a0teachers alike that this is the only bargaining chip being put forth by the union \u2013 especially when the importance of extracurricular activities is highly emphasized as a priority by many prominent experts.The 2012 Active Healthy Kids Canada recently released its report card on physical activity for children and youth in the nation, asking the question: Is active play extinct?According to the report, children are more likely to be physically active between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., if given the opportunity. Police-reported crime for youth also peaks in the after-school period.In order to encourage participation in after-school activities and decrease youth crime trends, extracurricular sports and clubs that \u201cseek to address wider personal and social development\u201d will tackle this issue.In other words, extracurriculars, despite not being mandated as part of the curriculum, are important to a child\u2019s overall development. It\u2019s a safe bet that elementary school children under the age of 11 won\u2019t adopt a life of crime in the wake of the union\u2019s decision. But the positive benefits resulting from after school activities is undeniable. So who do we blame when students in Ontario are no longer reaping the obvious benefits of after-school art, soccer or volleyball? It certainly isn\u2019t the teachers, who, while put in a difficult position due to their line of work, should have the same rights as other citizens in negotiating contracts. By taking away their bargaining powers, the government further disadvantaged teachers, who had previously supported McGuinty in his campaign by running various electoral support advertisements. It\u2019s the strategy of the unions we should be questioning.For union president Sam Hammond it\u2019s a tactic to get the Ontario government to act and act quickly. \u201cThe premier and education minister are deluding themselves if they think the repeal of Bill 115 will promote goodwill and stability in the education sector and restore their popularity,\u201d said Hammond in a written statement.\u201cThey used the bill and are now trying to make it disappear in the most crass of political acts. It\u2019s a sleight of hand that ETFO members and most Ontarians will see through.\"That's easy to say when you\u2019re not on the front lines dealing with disappointed and angry parents.Since September, students have been able to participate in few to no extracurricular activities. Shouldn\u2019t part of the onus of facilitating these activities and filling time be on the parents as well?A children\u2019s programming co-ordinator at an Ottawa community centre says the centre has seen a spike in registration for youth memberships and course registration. It isn\u2019t free, of course, but it\u2019s a move towards ensuring children are maintaining an active lifestyle. And if community programs cost too much or aren\u2019t convenient enough, there is a time when parents can voice their opinion on education policies that directly affect their children: the next election. No one comes out on top in this situation. The teachers are forced into accepting the decisions of their union, parents are on a finger-pointing rampage and the kids continue to do, well, nothing. ",

There are also a few homosexual-themed comics.But since mid-February, customers haven\u2019t found any comics by Orson Scott Card. Card writes a well-known Iron Man series and rose to fame in the 1980s for penning the renowned science fiction novel Ender\u2019s Game.Card wrote an essay in 2004 that called gay marriage a \u201cpotentially devastating social experiment.\u201d He\u2019s also on the board of directors of an American organization that opposes legalizing same-sex marriage.The Comic Book Shoppe made the right decision to not stock his works because doing so would go against the village's purpose: to be gay-friendly.Rob Spittall, co-owner of The Comic Book Shoppe, says he learned about the author\u2019s homophobic views after DC Comics announced last month it would release a Card-penned Superman series in April.That was enough of a reason to stop selling his comics, Spittall says. His store is a private business, so he can decide what he wants to stock. Besides, why should he sell something comic book lovers don\u2019t intend to read?There\u2019s a lot of backlash against Card creating a Superman series. A petition on a gay rights advocacy website that asks DC Comics to drop the author has more than 16,000 signatures. A petition supporting him on another website has fewer than 230 names.Though other stores have stopped stocking Card\u2019s comics due to Internet outrage, Spittall\u2019s decision to do the same is especially important.In 2005, the gay village committee began lobbying Ottawa to acknowledge the neighbourhood as such.The city officially recognized the village less than two years ago by adding street signs with rainbow decals to Bank Street intersections at James, Nepean and Somerset streets.Stocking comics with Card\u2019s name on the cover would be a disservice to the committee\u2019s tireless, six-year effort to create a homosexual-inclusive community.In fact, The Comic Book Shoppe has always been gay-friendly and supported the village, says Ian Capstick, the committee\u2019s business relations chair.Capstick, who adds he\u2019s a comic fan, says the store hangs rainbow flags for Capital Pride and is a business that \u201cactively and excitedly supports its gay and lesbian customers.\u201dWhy would Spittall jeopardize his store\u2019s reputation, the niche market it holds and the respect of a neighbourhood which it calls home?It\u2019s clear he made the right choice.Besides, when customers open a door that has a prominent rainbow sticker by the handle and a number of homosexual-themed comics behind the windows, it\u2019s safe to say they don\u2019t want to flip through a comic that a controversial homophobe wrote.",

The coffeehouse is hosting monthly theatre nights in an effort to create more performance space for artists  in Ottawa. It\u2019s still early evening on Feb. 22, but the small venue on Gladstone Avenue is already packed with about 40 people. They fill every seat at the small, dimly lit sandwich bar\u2019s wooden tables. New arrivals have to stand huddled near the door, stage left.\r\rOn that stage, spoken word poet and entrepreneur Sergio Guerra leans toward the audience, reciting passionate passages about politics, spirituality and family. Later, singer-songwriter Keturah Johnson fiercely thrums an acoustic guitar and lets loose about mental illness. In between acts, members from 8th Generation Performance Group squat, squirm, stagger and shout their way through improv sets.This is just a taste of the group\u2019s first theatre night at Pressed Urban Sandwich Bar. Known for its gourmet sandwiches, the venue is becoming a hotspot for local performers. This makes it an ideal long-term home for theatre nights, says 8th Generation founder Jacqui Du Toit.\u201cThe energy in this place is emerging,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s new, it\u2019s a beautiful vibe in here, so I think that compliments theatre nights and it allows for this network to happen.\u201dThe events will take place on the last Friday of each month and have been booked at Pressed through May. They began at the Patrick John Mills Contemporary Fine Art Gallery, Du Toit says. The performance troupe would collaborate with other local artists to put on shows based around Mills\u2019s exhibits. From there, theatre nights grew into a platform for creators to collaborate and for new artists to perform original works, she says.After gallery restrictions forced theatre nights to move in May 2012, they settled in at the GigSpace Performance Studio on Gladstone Avenue. While more people showed up after the move, Du Toit says she wanted a place with a better vibe. She found that with Pressed, she says.The events represent progress in the arts community, Du Toit says. There aren\u2019t many venues in the area that allow actors to hone their craft.\u201cI find with Ottawa, it\u2019s still quite linear in terms of how they view theatre,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd coming from South Africa, for me, theatre is all about expression and telling stories, and making a sacred space.\u201dOttawa is still in the process of developing its artistic scene, but that means its artists have the unique opportunity to dictate its direction. That makes it an exciting place, says Guerra, who performs under the name Hyf the GypsySun. He compares the Centretown community to the Greenwich Village arts scene in New York City.\u201cI think we get the most fusion bands and acts, you know,\u201d Guerra says. \u201cPeople doing really different things, because we have less of an overarching scene, monopolizing us from above, telling us that this is good and this is not good.\u201dThe theatre nights bring spontaneity to the scene, Guerra adds.\u201cWe\u2019re building community, right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where people can go and see what\u2019s happening with the theatre community and, in addition, meet different artists going on. So we need more of those events going on all the time.\u201dThe events also put a new spin on the community\u2019s \u201coral culture,\u201d says Pressed owner Jeff Stewart. He adds that they fit in well with the shop\u2019s music and poetry events.\u201cI just like the idea of having things that are a little bit fringier and might not be able to find a venue, generally, to have them,\u201d he says. \u201cI think those things often are what people who are sort of enjoying living downtown in a city look for, and it\u2019s nice to be able to combine food and a beer with some local culture and a little bit of edgier, fringier type stuff.\u201d",

    "body": "When Pressed, one of Centretown\u2019s most buzzed-about establishments, announced its dining room would soon be hosting live theatre on weekends, it was a welcome, yet not unprecedented, addition to the local arts scene. Its eclectic calendar of trivia nights, arts events and live music aligns the Gladstone Avenue hangout with a swelling roster of businesses around town that double as small performance venues.\r\rBut while it\u2019s hard to deny the benefits that pattern can have for artists, the growing number of dining room-cum-concert halls in the city also underscores something less positive: its lack of mid-size performance spaces. Small venues \u2013 neighbourhood caf\u00e9s, favourite watering holes \u2013 may offer a platform for fledgling musicians, but if their ambitions include graduating to the status of career performers, they\u2019ll eventually look to expand the reach of their music and the scope of their stage show. For that, they might look to the city\u2019s mid-sized venues, clubs like Babylon and Ritual \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 many of which currently seem more committed to booking DJs than live music.With some effort, those venues could also be a draw for out-of-town acts. One need only plug the search term \u201cOttawa concerts\u201d into Google to see the majority of live shows in town occupy one of two opposing poles: those that will sell out the behemoth Scotiabank Place and those that might draw a few extra patrons to the pub down the street. For well-known bands with followings more modest than that of, say, Neil Young or Fleetwood Mac, the former venue is a daunting space to fill. The latter isn\u2019t worth their time. So, many of them don\u2019t come at all.While that lack of imported talent, on its surface, might not seem like such a significant problem for local bands, it does have an impact. Competition for performance space, or simply having your name on the same bill as a well-known, forces emerging artists to up their game and grants them increased exposure. That publicity also makes it more likely that they, in turn, may be able to hit the road themselves.For a blueprint of a successful music scene, consider Austin, Texas, the self-proclaimed live music capital of the world. With a population of just over 820,000, it\u2019s smaller than Ottawa, and as the state capital it shares its status as a government town. Obviously, there are numerous differences between the two cities, but looking at Austin, it can\u2019t be said that Ottawa lacks the population to support a vibrant music scene. No, what Ottawa lacks is infrastructure.One key to that infrastructure involves the venues themselves, the nodes on the map to and from which musicians, promoters and fans flow. In cities such as Austin, where it is difficult to walk down a street on your way to a show without passing two or three other venues boasting equally appealing bills, that network is already in place \u2013\u00a0and musicians and businesses, both local and otherwise, thrive.Ottawa has the raw materials to harbour and sustain a healthy independent music scene. It\u2019s home to talented artists, a growing web of alternative media outlets, and indie record labels that are both hardworking and committed to promoting local music. More importantly, each faction of that developing scene approaches its individual tasks with enough enthusiasm to almost overshadow the perennial criticism that the city\u2019s musical listings are, generally, uninspiring. Thus far, their efforts have proven that a bit of investment \u2013 of both time and resources \u2013 can go a long way. Matching that investment, in the city\u2019s venues, existing and otherwise, is the next step in putting Ottawa and its emerging artists on the musical map.",

With a simple drag of a mouse, you can see what an intersection in Centretown looked like in 1920 and, at the same time, what it looks like today.\r\r\u201cOttawa Pass\u00e9 & Pr\u00e9sent\u201d (Ottawa Past & Present) is the brainchild of 33-year-old Alexandre Laquerre, an engineer at Fibics Inc., who has made Ottawa his home since 2006.It\u2019s an interactive blog that juxtaposes what specific areas in downtown Ottawa look like now with how the exact location looked like as far back as 90 years ago.\u201cOttawa has a lot of footprints of what it used to look like \u2013 it makes the whole thing even more interesting,\u201d Laquerre says. \u201cNot many cities in Canada are like that.\u201dThe fascination to find out what places looked like before, say, a building was demolished, began with the redevelopments in his hometown.\u201cIn Quebec City, they did terrible things with the downtown core. I think they sort of did the same thing in Ottawa,\u201d he says. \u201cI always wondered, \u2018what was there before?\u2019\u201d\\When he moved to Ottawa, he brought that question with him.Laquerre started the project with the launch of his website in October and has recently posted a host of current and archival pictures of Centretown, bringing his tally to more than 180 past-and-present photos of intersections, buildings and streets in the downtown area. The juxtaposition allows users to virtually scroll through time over superimposed images from the past and present, making for a surreal visual experience. The website also includes an interactive map pinned with all the areas that Laquerre has compared.But for him, the project is more than just comparing what parts of the city look like now to what they did many years ago.\u201cI want people to be aware, that at some point, someone made the decision that this street should be widened or that building should be torn down. And to me, I think it was not the right decision,\u201d Laquerre says.He says that downtown Ottawa is in a poorer state today than what it was 50 years ago because of unfortunate planning and a lack of vision. One section of Laquerre\u2019s blog reads: \u201cThe Gr\u00e9ber Plan and the NCC transformed Ottawa for the worst. One building at a time.\u201d Led by Frenchman Jacques Gr\u00e9ber, the NCC announced a plan in 1946 to make Ottawa a world-class capital. A product of this controversial plan was the razing of LeBreton Flats, a decision that Laquerre says just didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cI was shocked when I realized it was a complete neighbourhood and they\u2019re going to tear it down just to make room for government buildings which never happened,\u201d he says.Laquerre says he believes the NCC has focussed too much on green spaces and has failed in making downtown Ottawa a more vibrant place in which to live.\u201cI think that the people in charge at the NCC don\u2019t have a good sense of what the city should be,\u201d he says, adding the apartments (where William Lyon Mackenzie King once lived) that stood where Confederation Park is today should not have been demolished. Armed with a camera and pictures from the past from Library and Archives Canada, Laquerre hit the streets to show how things were, in his opinion, better back in the day. \u201cThe main goal is to take the exact same picture as the one I have from the archives,\u201d he says.Laquerre says despite it being a challenge, he picked up some tricks on the way to making his snapshots as similar as possible to the older ones.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe hardest things this is when there\u2019s nothing (in the shot) to relate to,\u201d Laquerre says. \u201cAny buildings or landmarks that were there in 1930 don\u2019t exist anymore, so you kind of have to guesstimate where the photographer was.\u201dLaquerre\u2019s creative initiative has earned him plaudits from Heritage Ottawa, which says that the project is more than just a tool to study history.\u201cThis is a splendid way to help modern Ottawans connect with their built past, by seeing it alongside the built present,\u201d says Leslie Maitland, president of Heritage Ottawa.\u201cThrough the modern image, one can readily imagine stepping back in time to the same location, but in the past.\u201dWith more than a thousand pictures from Library and Archives Canada still waiting to be juxtaposed, Laquerre says he will continue chipping away at what he calls is a \u201cwork in progress.\u201dLaquerre\u2019s website is at: http://www.alexandrelaquerre.com/.",

They will trust me to be the next MPP for Ottawa Centre,\u201d McKenzie said in her opening speech to more than 250 riding association members.McKenzie said education will be an important issue for voters in the next provincial election, whether they have children in school or not. She called it the \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d of incumbent Liberal MPP Yasir Naqvi, who supported Bill 115, which imposed a contract on teachers.\u201cOur schools have been badly affected by Bill 115 and we need to make sure it\u2019s corrected as quickly as possible,\u201d McKenzie said.Issues affecting Ottawa Centre that McKenzie said she will focus on are affordable housing, healthcare and property taxes.McKenzie said development in Ottawa\u2019s downtown core is \u201cout of control,\u201d and suggested that the province should reform or abolish the Ontario Municipal Board, the tribunal that hears appeals and disputes on planning and municipal issues. \u201cWe must bring back local decision-making to this community,\u201d McKenzie said.Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath, who attended the meeting, said the time for the next election will be up to Premier Kathleen Wynne, who is holding on to a minority government.\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily want to campaign, but what we do want and what we\u2019re going to fight for is real results for the people of this province,\u201d Horwath said. \u201cI\u2019ve told the premier clearly that New Democrats have expectations when it comes to the budget that\u2019s going to be tabled in the next weeks to come.\u201dUniversity of Ottawa NDP co-chair Stephen Hampton worked on McKenzie\u2019s nomination campaign and said he hopes the politicians at Queen\u2019s Park can work together to avoid an election.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants it right now, especially the people of Ontario,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cBut if it does happen sooner than later, Jennifer will be more than prepared, and she has a great team behind her and lots of support.\u201dCullen, an aide to NDP MP Mike Sullivan, said McKenzie was a \u201cworthy opponent\u201d and it was great to see the turnout of voters.\u201cShe\u2019s an excellent candidate, she\u2019s got community roots, she\u2019s shown leadership on the school board, and I think that the folks in Ottawa Centre will do very well to have her as their MPP,\u201d Cullen said.

But Edwards told the committee his vision did not stop there.\u201cIt\u2019s about more than a sidewalk, more than a bus stop. It\u2019s the quality of the urban experience that is going to change people\u2019s opinion about our downtown core,\u201d he says.Kanata North Coun. Marianne Wilkinson greeted the plan warmly, saying the lack of imagination and life in the city core is a major downfall of the city.\u201cThe downtown streets I call dead. Dead walls,\u201d Wilkinson told the committee.Gloucester-Southgate Coun. Diane Deans agreed.And while she thought the Downtown Moves proposal is a step in the right direction, Deans said she feels there is still a whole lot more work to be done. A great number of concerns were raised, ranging from lack of funding, to spiraling cost, to loss of parking spaces, height restrictions, and implementation issues. But Craig Stevenson, the general manager of Hy\u2019s Steakhouse \u2013 located on Queen Street \u2013 welcomes the idea with open arms. He says he doesn\u2019t think that the loss of parking spots will be as big an issue as some of the committee members have made it out to be. \u201cParking is already so limited here,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cThe more people that walk mean more exposure and ultimately more people walking into the restaurant.\u201dBut people need a reason to walk on the street, and Barrhaven Coun.

What the plan lacks for Harder is a complementary plan to attract people to the downtown core. ",

    "body": "Plans are in the works to make Bronson Avenue safer for cyclists and pedestrians following the death of a cyclist last fall.\r\rThe City of Ottawa, along with the Carleton University Graduate Students\u2019 Association and CU Cycling, were on hand to hear residents\u2019 feedback about the new plans, as well as what they would also like to see improved along busy Bronson Avenue.One of the proposed changes is lowering the speed limit along Bronson Avenue to 60 km/h in places where it is currently 70. Where it is 60 km/h currently, the speed limit would be reduced to 50. The proposals, drafted by the city, come in the wake of the death of Krista Johnson, who was killed in October while cycling along Bronson Avenue.Capital ward Coun. David Chernushenko says there are a number of small changes being proposed which will all make a difference. Chernushenko says Bronson Avenue often resembles a highway, making it unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. \u201cPeople need to be reminded they are driving through communities.\u201d Other proposed changes include replacing the on-and-off ramps to Colonel By Drive so cars aren\u2019t speeding while driving on or off them. The city also wants the bike lanes to hug the curb, rather than forcing cyclists to cut in front of traffic.Alice-Rose Mick, a member of CU Cycling, says the proposals are much needed. \u201cUnfortunately, it takes really horrible things to happen for people to realize this is a high traffic area where people are walking and biking. We need to be safe.\u201dMick says as a cyclist, the proposed changes would help her and others feel safer. \u201cIt\u2019s said \u2018if you build it, they will come.\u2019 If you build safe roads and bike paths, people are going to use it for that.\u201dChernushenko says the implementation of a crosswalk at Brewer Way would help drivers become more aware of their speed while zooming along Bronson Avenue. He says it\u2019s just one more light that will hopefully slow people down. \u201cWe don\u2019t want drivers to zone out and think \u2018I\u2019m on the highway, I can daydream.\u2019 No, you need to be aware.\u201dDanny Handelman says the stretch has posed problems for pedestrians for a long time. \u201cI\u2019ve been aware of the poor quality of walking along Bronson for many years. It\u2019s more like a highway than a street.\u201dAs a pedestrian, Handelman says he would like to see trees or tall bushes placed along the median on Bronson Avenue. He says he thinks this will create an atmosphere where drivers would slow down because it would give the impression they are driving down residential-like streets.Chernushenko agrees that action must be taken. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make our design with what people feel is safe,\u201d Chernushenko says. \u201cIt\u2019s not making your commute longer \u2013 it\u2019s making your commute safer and more pleasant.\u201d It is expected the proposals will be presented to the transportation committee in April.

    "body": "Erin Morawetz, Centretown NewsBIA chairman Sam Elsaadi, owner of La Mode Hair Studio, says he fears businesses will go belly up. Business owners on Sparks Street are concerned they won\u2019t survive the next four years due to major construction on buildings along the north side of the street, says Sparks Street BIA chairman Sam Elsaadi. \r\rAccording to Elsaadi, who also owns La Mode Hair Studio, construction has been going on for the past two years, leading to fewer and fewer visitors, who are turned off by the scaffolding and cranes along the mall. Public Works and Government Services Canada owns the buildings along the north side of Sparks Street. In an email, spokeswoman Annie Duguay wrote that Public Works is \u201cinvesting in the vitality of Sparks Street by completing extensive rehabilitations to the buildings along the north side of Sparks Street.\u201dShe added that the Wellington Building at 180 Wellington St. is currently under construction with renovation plans still being studied for certain buildings on the north side of Sparks. Leases for these buildings have not been extended past 2014, until long-term plans are finalized. However, Elsaadi points out that these longer-term leases will not be of any use if businesses close. \u201cThis construction is going to continue until 2014 or even 2016. Whether you have a lease for 10 years or you have a lease for 20 years, it\u2019s not going to do anything until all this construction is done,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to give me the security that I can survive if there\u2019s no people on the street.\u201dElsaadi says business for La Mode dropped 25 to 30 per cent since construction began two years ago. The historic Canada\u2019s Four Corners building is a souvenir shop founded 50 years ago at the corner of Sparks and Metcalfe streets.Part-owner Lila Ghaffari says the store has felt the construction\u2019s impact, but that\u2019s not the only reason for declining business. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of economic crisis and of course, (the construction) is horrendous for us,\u201d she says. \u201cOur building has been, as you can see, like a carcass is around it. Thank God we are where we are and we have a reputation\u2026(we are) like a landmark in Ottawa otherwise it would be catastrophic.\u201dShe says Canada\u2019s Four Corners already had to relocate in 1997 when its building was renovated.The Sparks Street BIA meets monthly with representatives from Public Works and the National Capital Commission, which owns the south side of Sparks Street, to address tenant concerns.Taking a walk down Sparks Street, it is not unusual to see boarded up front windows and relocation signs. The area is empty of visitors and the street is quiet, except for the sounds of hammers and banging metal. Ghaffari describes the Sparks Street she remembers when she immigrated to Canada from Iran.\u201cWhen I came to Canada 34 years ago, the market was dead. There was nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cNow go to the market . . . it\u2019s the \u2018it\u2019 place to be in the city. And this street was the classy pedestrian mall with very exquisite shops in it. Everybody would recommend you to go to Sparks Street Mall and now look at the desolate way this street looks like.\u201dElsaadi says the best way to ensure more businesses do not go under during construction is for Public Works to give all the tenants equal financial compensation to make up for the money they lose over the next four years and to announce it publicly.\u201cGive them a promise of hope,\u201d he says. In response to this, Lucie Brosseau of Public Works wrote that the department is willing to discuss lease issues individually with tenants, but she could not disclose any more information about lease agreements since they are supposed to remain confidential. \u201cPublic Works is committed to maintaining the commercial character of Sparks Street,\u201d she wrote. \u201c(Public Works) works with its tenants, starting at the planning phase and continuing throughout the duration of its projects, to minimize disruption during construction.\u201dElsaadi says Public Works has never forced any business to leave and tries to accommodate those located in buildings undergoing renovations, by finding temporary location spaces. He adds that businesses usually can\u2019t survive the business lost from relocating.Both Elsaadi and Ghaffari agree the street needs more visitors for businesses to stay alive.Ghaffari also says Public Works has to add a variety of shops to the street, including entertainment, dining and retail stores, which will attract more consumers. She says planners should allocate a certain number of each type of business (restaurant, souvenir, clothing, etc.) to ensure a balanced but wide array of attractions.Elsaadi says the Sparks Street BIA is working on beautifying the street with new lights, benches and flowers. He says the BIA also hosts annual events such as the Busker Festival, Ribfest, Beer Fest, and the last New Year\u2019s Eve party that drew in 20,000 people. Recent proposals for a zip line and valet parking on Sparks Street are also meant to add to the street\u2019s revitalization. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all these events to keep the street busy, but if the street isn\u2019t completely full it\u2019s not going to attract people to come back,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can\u2019t stop these events. We\u2019re not going to slow down.\u201d",

    "body": "Small business owners face challenges separate from their larger counterparts that make them more vulnerable to scams.\r\rLast month, a telemarketing scam based in Montreal targeted small businesses in Ottawa, they promised to improve companies' online presence. The caller would ask for a mailing address, saying the company would send a package that explains the services available. But the package came with an invoice for $500, for services not asked for or received. A business owner targeted by this scam, Emily McDonell, who owns an Ottawa boutique, says she endured harassing calls from the scammers, who threatened legal action. She eventually paid the invoice by credit card. She only cancelled the payment after she called an online security expert who recognized this as a scam and they broke this story with the CBC to help prevent others falling prey to the same scam.Small businesses are identified as having fewer than 100 employees, according to Statistics Canada. The agency reported in July 2012 that there are more than 2.4 million businesses in Canada, with more than 1.1 million of those being small businesses. \u201cA big part of making sure a business owner does not fall prey to a scam is due diligence,\u201d says James Stock, a third-year business and commerce major at Carleton University. Stock says his program does not discuss in much detail how to verify the validity of an outside company that a business may pay for services. Rather he sees this as a soft skill that has to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. When trying to avoid being swindled, small businesses are at a disadvantage. Larger businesses have more resources, whereas small businesses may look to hire outside companies for services, such as strengthening their presence online.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhen you have a small business and resources are really tight, you have to be very particular about where you concentrate your time and money,\u201d says Stock. In his program, business law is a mandatory course, and Stock says they examine how to protect a business, especially through having proper insurance and incorporating a business (registering it as its own entity), which helps owners with costly legal expenses. Not every person who gets into business attends business school. This can be a challenge for business owners who may not know everything about protecting their company.To help business owners, the Canada Revenue Agency provides an online guide for small businesses, offering information on getting started, business terms and definitions, taxes, audits and available help and services. The RCMP also provides tips online for spotting and reporting telemarketing fraud. The Canadian Better Business Bureau provides standards and accreditation for businesses. It also offers a variety of programs and resources.The concern is that businesses are still becoming victims of scams, and ensuring they make use of the resources available is crucial. Small business may be intimidated by scammers; they may also be more easily tricked than owners of large businesses because they have fewer resources to check the legitimacy of services to which they are outsourcing.Business owners have to protect themselves and their companies by knowing what help is available for them, and similar to the situation last month, reporting any scams as quickly as possible so that other small business may also defend themselves. Owners of small businesses can help themselves and others by reporting any scams as soon as suspicion arises. This would encourage sentiments of good will and support for businesses with fewer resources. The sooner a scam is reported, the sooner it can be avoided by other businesses. Small business owners must not assume that everyone who offers services is genuinely out to help them. Rather, they have to take the necessary diligent steps to avoid being taken advantage of.",

Ottawa has more than 20 tattoo shops and the city has recently had to hire more inspectors to meet the demand.The Tattoo Hero team has been focusing on building a set of contacts with help from Start-Up Ottawa, which organized the November weekend, and InvestOttawa, which helped organize and donate prizes for Global Entrepreneurship Week. Teams of 12 were formed organically based on the top ideas. Then teams put together their business plan and pitched them to seasoned entrepreneurs. Start-Up Ottawa has provided the winners with mentors, experts, promotion, and tips for dealing with investors. InvestOttawa provided, as of November, three months of office space to Tannahill and his team on Aberdeen just off Preston. Gowlings LLP, an Ottawa law firm, offered $1,000 of legal support. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely on the right track.

Then they will begin charging for online consultations and offer limited-run pieces of merchandise. Waselnuk plans to only issue 100-150 of each piece of merchandise before switching designs. Tannahill admits that figuring out where the money comes from can be a challenge. More revenue generators are in development and will be announced later this year. For now the mood is that of cautious optimism.\u201cThe overall idea behind Tattoo Hero is a good one,\u201d says Shawn Carrier of Centretown\u2019s tattoo parlour The Ink Spot. \u201cBut there won\u2019t be a way to know for sure until it goes live.\u201dRegistration is now open for Ottawa\u2019s next Start-Up weekend, which will be held on May 24 at 126 York St. ",

    "body": "In a collaborative effort, Operation Come Home and Just Food have received a two-year grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation to launch FarmWorks, OCH\u2019s fifth social enterprise. \r\rSocial enterprises employ youth, who are either homeless or dangerously close to it, to provide products and services to Centretown. In return, these programs provide income, job experience and social support to help the youth get back on their feet and off the streets.The program will have 12 youths rotating through in groups of three, each for a 12-week period. They will be working an acre of land on Just Food\u2019s farm in Blackburn Hamlet. The youth will plant, weed, water and harvest organic heirloom vegetables, including squash, kale, spinach and a variety of culinary herbs.Spearheading FarmWorks is Catherine Dowdell, who says the program is extremely beneficial. \u201cLiterally and figuratively, it\u2019s a good way to ground people. Getting your hands into the dirt, into the earth, like our skin covers so much of our body, it\u2019s like the skin that\u2019s protecting the earth.\u201d According to the Ontario Trillium Foundation\u2019s website, the FarmWorks grant is valued at $158,800, enough to cover operating costs for two years. Once the grant runs out, the plan is to sustain FarmWorks through community supported agriculture shares. The shares model allows local customers to buy into a farm before the growing season starts. When the harvest starts rolling in, shareholders receive a portion of all the produce on a regular basis. The risk is that if the harvest flops, there are no refunds. FarmWorks is selling a total of 30 shares. The cost for each depends on where customers decide to pick up their weekly produce. If at the farm, shares cost $575 and $675 if pickup is at OCH. Dowdell says these prices are comparable to other CSAs, and that one share is enough to feed a family of four for the 18 week harvest. Dowdell says FarmWorks begins pre-training in mid-March, with the actual farming beginning in April or early May. She says her hope for the program is that it will be able to eventually provide year-round training, especially during winter, so OCH youth can have another opportunity to get out of the cold and learn valuable job skills.

More community engagement is needed to end violence against Canadian women, say anti-violence advocates in Ottawa. \r\rCommunities as a whole need to value women more as human beings, says Lula Adam, education co-ordinator of Interval House of Ottawa, a women\u2019s shelter. \u201c(Unless) all of us \u2013 women and men \u2013 get together and say we want this to end and there\u2019s no room for violence against women in our community, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she says.International Women\u2019s Day is a way to bring the community together to celebrate women\u2019s contributions to society, Adam says. \u201cIf we focus on that, then people will see the value of women and that in turn will make people see women as human beings that are making changes.\u201dTo this end, the Ottawa Coalition to End Violence Against Women is trying to engage men as allies with its Don\u2019t Be That Guy poster campaign promoting non-violence, says Stefanie Lomatski, the head of the coalition. A recent Statistics Canada report on violence against women found men committed 83 per cent of police-reported violent acts against women. In nearly half of the cases, the accused was the woman\u2019s intimate partner.The report also found about 56 per cent of the crimes against girls under the age of 12 were committed by a family member, including primary caregivers, siblings, or extended family members. \u201cIf the abuse starts then, what kind of mentality would this young woman grow up in thinking that she can accept or expect abuse from a community that would allow this to happen?\u201d Adam asks rhetorically.The report is based on data from police services and a Statistics Canada survey conducted every five years. It focused on gender-based violence such as physical or sexual assaults, uttering threats, and homicides. While police-reported attempted murders and physical assaults against women decreased between 2009 and 2011, sexual assaults increased in 2010 and remained stable in 2011. Statistics Canada also acknowledged that many women do not report violent incidences, which means police data only offers a glimpse of the whole issue, says Lomatski.For example, nine out of 10 non-spousal sexual assaults were never reported to police, according to the report. Meanwhile, less than one-third of female victims of spousal violence said they reported to the police, down from 36 per cent in the previous Statistics Canada survey of 2004. Stigma surrounding sexual assault and the lengthy processes of the criminal justice system keep some women from reporting crimes, says Lomatski. \u201cWomen are consistently re-victimized just by that whole system,\u201d she says.Ottawa has seen increasing education about the issue, says Nancy Worsfold, executive director of Crime Prevention Ottawa. \u201cThere\u2019s been huge progress made both in terms of the discussion about the issue and the acceptance that this is a big issue,\u201d she says.But Adam says she has not seen much improvement because women\u2019s shelters are still full. She says that the founders of Interval House weren\u2019t thinking that 37 years later, shelters would still be full. Ultimately, women have the right to feel safe, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a privilege. It\u2019s not something we beg for. It\u2019s something that we demand.\u201d",

    "body": "Homeless people living in shelters across Ontario have begun receiving a lump-sum payment every month, prompting some concerns that the change from smaller, weekly payouts could result in binge spending and a host of social problems.\r\rThe money, formerly known as the Personala Needs Allowance, had been distributed in weekly amounts of $28 to those who stayed in a shelter all week.But the Ontario government recently changed the system. As of Jan. 1, the renamed Basic Needs Allowance is now given as a significantly larger monthly payment. The new amount is $230, which totals $118 more than the PNA had provided each month when given in weekly instalments.In an interview with the CBC earlier this month, Ottawa police Staff Sgt. Kal Ghadban expressed concern that welfare payments similar to the new Basic Needs Allowance have created problems in the past, as crime rates went up because recipients were spending the money right away. \u201cThey would live like kings and queens for a week, and then wouldn\u2019t have two nickels to rub together for three weeks,\u201d Ghadban stated. \u201cBy the third and fourth week, we\u2019d start seeing our break-ins and thefts from vehicles going up again.\u201dSome advocates for homeless people are also worried that the large, lump sum payments could lead to increased crime, drug and alcohol abuse. The revamped payout program is part of the Community Homelessness Prevention Initiative run by the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing.It has earmarked $246 million for the program for 2013-14, which replaces the previous allowance which was issued by Ontario Works.The change to a different department enables local service managers to use the money \u201cto address local priorities and to better meet the needs of individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless,\u201d according to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing\u2019s website.While the program started last month, the first round of payments did not go out until the week of Feb. 11.The change means that local shelters and service centres in Centretown and across Ottawa have had to adjust to the new system.Centre 507, located in the Centretown United Church on Bank Street, has a Rooming House Tenant Program and is among the agencies involved in supporting homeless people in Ottawa.A spokesperson from Centre 507 could not be reached for a comment about the new program.Lewis Novack, a second-year Carleton University student, is the community service chair of the Rohr Chabad Student Network of Ottawa, a Jewish students\u2019 group on campus.Chabad has been involved in many events that involve making and serving food at Shepherds of Good Hope and The Ottawa Mission.He thinks it\u2019s not the money \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 that causes problems, but the lack of effective assistance programs to help people budget their social assistance income.\u201cThere should be programs that teach people how to manage their money,\u201d Novack says. \u201cSaying people without money cause crime is an inadequate statement. (The problem isn\u2019t) solved by locking them up in jail, but rather by creating outreach programs.\u201dThe Ottawa Mission, in fact, does have a budgeting program, which teaches people how to spend their money wisely and even helps people set up bank accounts.Staff members at homeless shelters and service centres in Ottawa were notified of the new allowance a few weeks ago and have had some time to prepare themselves to deal with it.Even though addiction counsellors at The Ottawa Mission have expressed concerns about the change, Shirley Roy, the downtown shelter\u2019s community relations manager, says it\u2019s working to try to create a smooth transition.\u201cPeople may have a hard time budgeting their money, but we\u2019re going to try our best to work with people who have concerns over their money (management) skills,\u201d she says.Right now, the mission is focused on working to \u201ctry to streamline the process\u201d to make sure it succeeds, she says.But the effects of implementing the Basic Needs Allowance \u2013 positive or negative \u2013 won\u2019t be seen for another few months.

After a bizarre naming controversy, Ottawa\u2019s new National Basketball League (NBL) of Canada franchise is ready to move into a busy summer before it plays in its inaugural season in 2013-14.\r\rAt a press conference in late February, owner Gus Takkale said his primary goal is to bring a championship to Ottawa. But another concern may loom larger than winning and losing, and that is simply surviving as a franchise.\u201cI\u2019m a businessman; I\u2019m an entrepreneur,\u201d Takkale said. \u201cMy job was to go establish businesses all over the world. When it comes to Ottawa, we really think that this is a basketball city.\u201dBut in a city that, in the last 20 years, has lost a professional baseball team (AAA\u2019s Lynx) and two professional football teams (the CFL\u2019s Rough Riders and then its reincarnation, the Renegades) winning may not be enough to keep people interested.\u201cNow I know there are some franchises that have opened up in the past and closed, but one of them was sold out for the first year,\u201d Takkale says of the Renegades.\u201cSomething happened, something went wrong.\u201dAnd Takkale stresses that he will take it into his own hands to make sure nothing goes wrong for his basketball franchise.\u201cWe\u2019re going to listen to our fans to see how we can develop ourselves,\u201d says Takkale. \u201cI\u2019m going to be personally there speaking to a lot of people at game day itself. I\u2019m not going to be the kind of owner that\u2019s going to sit up top in my suite. I\u2019m going to be there, I\u2019m going to stand in line, see how long it takes for the beer to come, I\u2019m going to be around with the children \u2013 so I want to make sure that we are involved in the community. This is a one on one business; if you\u2019re good to the marketplace, the marketplace is good to you.\u201dJo-Anne Polak, former general manager of the Rough Riders, stresses the importance of civic involvement in this city for any new business. \u201cIt has to be very community-oriented,\u201d says Polak. \u201cIt has to go to every Kiwanis Club, every Kinsmen Club, every school. That\u2019s the one thing I learned early on: that stuff matters to this town.\u201dPolak says Ottawa is an economically unique city because of the presence of the federal government. She says its population and the stable disposable income of many of its residents makes it a viable town for businesses to thrive in.\u201cThe foundation is strong for somebody to be able to come in and package and sell their product the right way,\u201d Polak says. \u201cBut you\u2019ve really got to know your city.\u201dTakkale says that his intended fan base is \u201canybody who loves basketball.\u201d\u201cOur target market is really not a demographic by age, but it\u2019s more by passion and love for the game,\u201d he says. \u201cBut also we want to make sure it\u2019s a family and entertainment experience; there\u2019s things for the kids to do, there\u2019s things for the adults to do, there\u2019s things for everybody to do at game day itself.\u201dThe team, led by Bytown Sports and Entertainment Group, will hire a coaching staff, then fill its roster in the coming months.Takkale says the team\u2019s talent pool would range from all over the world.A minimum of three Canadian players is required on each team, but he says his team would be predominantly made up of Americans, with some Europeans as well. He says there will be an emphasis on homegrown talent, and while there is currently no relationship with perennial basketball powerhouse Carleton University, that is something that will be explored.\u201cNow that we have launched the brand we\u2019re going to be kicking off conversations with all the universities and colleges,\u201d Takkale says.The team will play its first season at Scotiabank Place, where it will try to raise a championship banner to the rafters. The greater victory might be to survive their first season, and more importantly, according to Polak, beyond the first year.\u201cYou build your fan base and you build it slowly and you build it steadily,\u201d says Polak. \u201cIs everybody going to fill the place the first year? No. That\u2019s not how any product is sold. People build, and build slowly, and build a foundation of strength and have patience, and make sure that their business model reflects that.\u201dAt first glance, Polak says she feels Ottawa and its new basketball team are a suitable match.\u201cI believe that everybody \u2013 if they do it right \u2013 can survive in this city,\u201d Polak says. \u201cI believe it\u2019s a perfect market for a team like that.\"\"If managed properly, there is no better market you want to be in.\u201d",

    "body": "The Ontario Soccer Association recently announced that\u00a0 leagues for players under the age of 12 would no longer be keeping track of scores or standings. \r\rBy 2014, scores and standings will be a thing of the past across the province in those age groups.The system has already been implemented in many places around the world, including Europe.It\u2019s a nice attempt with good intentions. But kids aren\u2019t the problem. They never were.Parents and over-zealous coaches are and always will be the problem.First, my own experience with intense soccer parents.I can remember standing in the middle of the soccer field, 10-year-old players all running around while their 40-year-old coach screamed at me.I was 13 and had been a soccer referee for little over a month. The coach told me to be careful because he had a parent recording the game and would make sure I never refereed again.I didn\u2019t know how to deal with this; my voice still hadn\u2019t even cracked.The coach, who also happened to be a parent, was banned from coaching and I continued refereeing, albeit with a bit less passion than before.Getting rid of the scoring system won\u2019t change a thing.Parents will still keep track of the score. They\u2019ll assign their team points for winning or tying games, while critiquing when they lose. They will still get in arguments with referees and other officials over missed calls and fouls given.The soccer association\u2019s proposal hinges on the argument that by no longer keeping track of scores or league standings, coaches won\u2019t pressure their teams to solely focus on winning.It\u2019s part of Canada Soccer\u2019s plan dubbed \u201cWellness to World Cup Long Term Player Development Proposal,\u201d which aims to encourage coaches to focus more on the development of players over trying to win games.The plan includes improving coaching, while also encouraging kids to continue participating in soccer regardless of skill level.Ron Smale, president of the Ontario Soccer Association, says that part of the push for an abolition of keeping score is drop out rates from kids who are sick of seeing their team lose games.\u201cWe have been losing kids in big numbers in recent years and the feedback is inevitably the same:\u00a0kids are pressured at too early an age and coaches and parents yell all the time,\u201d he writes in an open letter.And he\u2019s right.Parents do yell. My parents yelled at me when I played, my friends\u2019 parents yelled at them. You would be hard pressed to go to any sports setting and not hear parents or coaches yell. But what remains unclear is how removing scores and league standings will change any of this. Jason de Vos, a former professional soccer player and a former coach with OSA, further elaborated on this in a recent column for TSN.He says that winning and losing are still important lessons for children to learn, but they need to learn it at an age where they can handle their emotions maturely.Further, he says the implementation is needed because \u201cadults are using scores and standings as the only measurement of success.\u201dAbolishing scores and league standings will not solve this.It will lead to more arguments among parents, from both teams, about who won the game.It\u2019s natural to want to win and prove yourself better than someone else. Coaches will still try to win, even if they can\u2019t point to official results.Kids need to learn how to win and lose.Keeping them from learning that at 12 doesn\u2019t make sense. By the time they\u2019re teenagers they need to understand what it feels like to lose.By not allowing them to lose, you\u2019re just sheltering them from the real world.Kids and adults need to learn how to lose and how to accept doing so.If the soccer association was abolishing scores as part of dealing with parents, then there should be more done to curb excessive parent behaviour.If you want to stop competitive parents, then admit it. Don\u2019t hide behind kids as an excuse.",

    "body": "Braedon Clark, Centretown NewsSports apparel store Clubhouse is taking heat from Ottawa fans  The owner of an Ottawa sports apparel store is on the defensive after he posted a picture of the shop\u2019s new sports cap with the words \u201cSens Suck\u201d online, infuriating fans of the home team. \r\rThe hoopla came after a photo of the \u201cSens Suck\u201d hat, next to a \u201cLeafs Suck\u201d cap also made by Clubhouse, went online on Feb. 24, the day after the Senators defeated their Ontario rivals 3-2.Clubhouse owner and manager Chris Torti says the caps are not for sale and were only meant to be a lighthearted poke at the rivalry between the Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Maple Leafs. \u201cIt was game day, and we had four caps. It was a gag and we ended up giving them to a couple of kids,\u201d Torti says. \u201c(The backlash) was totally blown out of proportion.\u201dSome sports bloggers criticized Clubhouse for selling products that insulted the home team. Steven Smith of Senstown.com wrote that cashing in on this rivalry in such a distasteful way was \u201cunacceptable.\u201dSeveral Senators fans went on Clubhouse\u2019s Twitter page to criticize the company, writing they would never use the store again. Red Scarf Union, a support group of diehard Senators fans, linked Clubhouse\u2019s customer feedback page in their tweet, encouraging upset fans to voice their concern.Torti says that Clubhouse, which has four locations in the Ottawa area including one by Scotiabank Place, sells more Leafs-related gear than Senators apparel. He credits this disparity to a local market saturated with low-price Senators merchandise.\u201cThere are a lot of fans of opposing teams in the city and I don\u2019t really have a problem with it,\u201d says Jared Crozier, senior editor of Senshot and a diehard Senators fan. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy (a \u2018Leafs Suck\u2019 hat) myself. It\u2019s not their responsibility to just sell something that is only Sens-related because they are in the city.\u201dThe online outcry came just two weeks after the Senators organization launched a \u201cTake Back the Bank\u201d initiative, which encouraged Ottawa fans to buy tickets for home games at a discount to keep Maple Leafs supporters away from Scotiabank Place. The Senators offered season ticket holders the chance to purchase additional tickets to Leafs games at a 20 per cent discount, as long as they did not sell those seats to Toronto fans. The idea for the initative came from team season ticket holders who said that they did not enjoy watching matches against the Maple Leafs due to the hostile atmosphere during the games, says Jeff Kyle, the Senators\u2019 vice-president of marketing.\u201cYou should be able to cheer for whatever team in a respectable way,\u201d Kyle says. \u201cWe also took the initiative to have added security. Sometimes, when you\u2019re at those games, people either have had a little too much fun before the game . . .\u00a0 or think that the action is sometimes off the ice, and they can get carried away.\u201dThe healthy contingent of Toronto fans around the province and the exorbitant prices at the Air Canada Centre have spawned a large number of out-of-towners visiting Scotiabank Place for Senators games.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we should discourage fans to come down but if you\u2019re going to give prime seats and great rates, it should go to your home team first,\u201d says Mika Oehling, an Ottawa writer and sports blogger. \u201c(Leafs fans) start a lot of fights. They\u2019re an aggressive bunch of people.\u201dHowever, Oehling says she did not have a problem with Clubhouse\u2019s cap concept.\u201cIt\u2019s part of the rivalry, part of the fun,\u201d she says. \u201cI want one of the \u2018Leafs Suck\u2019 ones.\u201dTorti, meanwhile, says he does not think that the online derision is loud enough to harm his business. \u201cI think that most people really see it for what it is,\u201d he says.",

Forgotten stories from the history of Ottawa\u2019s Chinese-Canadian community are being recovered and shared through a collaboration between a B.C. university and a Centretown cultural centre. \r\rChinese-Canadians were small in numbers in early 20th-century Ottawa, but formed a strong economic base after opening small caf\u00e9s, restaurants, grocery stores and laundries.These success stories are often overlooked in studies focused on segregation and racism, says Henry Yu, a history professor at the University of British Columbia and leader of a cross-Canada project aimed at preserving a wider range of Chinese-Canadian history.The Ottawa Chinese Community Service Centre is working with Yu on a local component of Chinese-Canadian Stories: Uncommon Histories from a Common Past, an initiative launched by the Community Historical Recognition Program with backing from the federal government. This project aims to tell the stories of Chinese-Canadians that are left out of the history books. \u201cThis country was created in 1867. There were plenty of people around (Canada) at that time and their stories aren\u2019t part of the mythical story of Canada,\u201d Yu says.Simon Fraser University and UBC have launched the $1.7-million history initiative in Ottawa and 29 other cities around the country.Ottawa's Chinese community centre on Kent Street received $50,000, says Robert Yip, a member of the OCCSC advisory committee.Yip says that the local co-ordinators of the project were up against the clock to find individuals who would share their stories. \u201cTime was of the essence. Many people are very elderly and unless we capture these stories today, they\u2019ll be lost forever.\u201d The centre started the two-part initiative a few years ago, but it recently reached a key milestone.In December, a public discussion was held at the Ottawa Public Library to hear the stories of some Chinese-Canadians.\u00a0 Denise Chong, a Chinese-Canadian journalist and author, led the conversation and was the main person behind the interviews now seen on the centre\u2019s website. The website, titled Lives of the Family, is a compilation of interviews with members of some of the first Chinese-Canadian families in Ottawa. The website also has historical facts about Canada at the time, and documents such as memoirs and photographs. The second part of the initiative is an interactive kiosk located at the entrance of the main branch of the Ottawa Public Library.This \u201clabour of love,\u201d according to Yu, was launched so that people can understand that negative stories and racism did exist, but that the Chinese people of Canada have a story that is so much more than that. Yu says these establishments were the heart of social life for many years in Western Canada. By teaching people about Chinese history, it \u201crounds out the story, makes it more poignant.\" \"This story shows how people survived and thrived despite the racism,\u201d Yu says.Yip echoes these sentiments. \u201cCanadian history to me is like the Hudson Bay blanket. It used to be predominantly white. Now it\u2019s more multicultural, more fabrics, more coloured.\u201dOne of the stories told through the project involved a couple named Woo and Sue Wong, who were among the earliest Chinese-Canadian residents in Ottawa, a small lumber town that was home \u2014 according to the 1901 census \u2014 to 170 Chinese residents, all males.\u00a0 Woo wanted to come to Canada to join her husband, Sue (or Su), who was waiting for her in this country. But they also had a three-year-old daughter, Kam Oi, and it was 1920 \u2014 a time when a $500 head tax was in place for would-be Chinese immigrants. The family didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for two members to become Canadians, so it was decided that Kam Oi would have to be left behind in the care of Sue\u2019s parents. Once in Ottawa, the couple had two other daughters, Mary and Annie. In 1924, Woo and Sue opened a grocery store in their home at 201 Albert St.\u00a0 The Yick Lung grocery store did not have set hours and often served as a gathering place for Chinese families. After having five more children, Woo still longed for the daughter that was left behind. In 1963, the family was reunited with Kam Oi. It was almost 40 years after the separation but only a few months before Sue died. ",

But, he told the Ottawa Citizen the issue has forced Beaver Barracks to provide those tenants with electric heaters and air conditioning, which is at odds with the building\u2019s sustainable energy policy. And it seems the problem isn\u2019t an easy fix. The statement of claim says there are defects in the\u00a0 design and construction of the geothermal distribution system. It also states the tenants have tried to fix the problems themselves, but haven\u2019t had much success.Besides, Sullivan said, the CCOC isn\u2019t even sure yet what it will take to fix the problem.Lorimer says he thinks the CCOC chose to file a claim without knowing the exact issue because he believes there is a statute of limitations to when the corporation could file.But Sullivan says the CCOC is figuring out who should fix it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a specialist team working on that right now,\u201d he told the Citizen.Lorimer says there are issues with hot water.

Ottawa police investigators say an organized crime ring is behind a spate of van thefts that has plagued Centretown and surrounding parts of Ottawa in recent months.\r\rWhile there has been no overall increase in vehicle thefts, there has been a spike in the number of stolen minivans, according to the Ottawa Police Service\u2019s organized auto theft division.Between Jan. 1 and March 7, 54 vans were stolen in Ottawa. During the same time period in 2012, just 17 vans were stolen.Ottawa journalist Shannon Lee Mannion had her locked van stolen from her garage on Florence Street. She said she put up posters to warn other people in the community and to try to get her van back.\u201cIf they\u2019re stealing vehicles, what\u2019s next?\u201d Mannion said. \u201cMaybe they start breaking in and stealing computers and other things.\u201dMannion said she did not expect her van to come back since the police had told her it was an organized crime ring that had probably crushed the car for its metal \u2013 which can yield considerable value given today\u2019s prices for scrap metal.According to the organized auto theft division, there are known suspects being investigated in connection with the van thefts.The signs posted on streets near the intersection of Somerset and Lyon ask: \u201cWhat is going on? Who is doing this?\u201dFor the organized auto theft division, the number of non-recovered vehicles is of more interest. Stolen vehicles are often discarded after a joy ride, but the stolen minivans are not turning up anywhere in Ottawa after being stolen.\u201cEither they\u2019re stripping the vehicles for parts or exporting them by putting a false identity on the vehicle, which all points to a degree of organization,\u201d said an officer with the division.Out of the 54 vans stolen this year, only 11 have been recovered, according to the police. Last year, 13 of the 17 stolen vans were recovered over the same stretch of time.Mannion\u2019s poster states: \u201cThieves took my locked van from my garage on Florence Street.\u201d The sign describes the van and asks anyone with information to contact the police. A high-profile van theft drew more attention to the situation in Centretown.On March 2, someone hijacked a parked van on Booth Street and drove it away with two children, aged three and five, still sleeping in the back seat. The van hit two cars before finally crashing into a building. The driver fled the scene, according to police.The children were found unharmed and given assistance by witnesses.According to police statistics, 1,468 vehicles were reported stolen in Ottawa in 2012, with 816 of those recovered.",

Construction of the highway began during a prosperous economic time through the 1950s. Two-thirds of Canadians owned cars by 1960 and trucking had become an increasingly efficient way of transporting goods. Today, 80 per cent of shipped goods in Canada use roadways.The vision of the Trans-Canada Highway even inspired the design of the 1954 Landscape Series bank notes which featured images of rural Canada.The Road Trip! exhibit includes carpeting that looks like roads, as well as information displays shaped like road signs that discuss the history and importance of the highway.The design was partly chosen to cater to children and families, and to serve as the focus of a series of activities during March Break.Laroche says that it\u2019s crucial to have something to interest kids in order to make the museum as accessible as possible.\u201cBy providing children with activities, it allows the adults to visit the exhibition quietly,\u201d she says.But the Road Trip! exhibit has another role. Because it\u2019s located just outside the main entrance, it helps attract passersby into the Currency Museum to see its other exhibits. Road Trip! is about \u201csomething more familiar. It draws on that to bring people into the museum to see more,\u201d Laroche says.The Bank of Canada established the Currency Museum in 1980 as an extension of the National Currency Collection. It had been collecting currency-related artifacts since the 1950s and decided a museum was the best way to display those objects while disseminating information about the Bank of Canada in an engaging manner.\u201cThere\u2019s something really evocative about genuine objects, genuine artifacts,\u201d said Raewyn Passmore, one of three curators at the museum.She says part of the museum\u2019s mission is to preserve Canada\u2019s monetary history and help Canadians better understand economics and financial systems.\u00a0\u201cUnless something like a change in bank notes occurs, most people don\u2019t really give a whole lot of thought to what money is, how it works, how it\u2019s created, and what\u2019s behind it,\u201d she says.

Eric Darwin, former president of the Dalhousie Community Association, outlined his personal concerns recently in a post on his community blog, West Side Action. \u201cWhile it (the CDP) calls for mixed use development, there is no plan to quantify that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are no intensification targets for jobs, residences, population, or even a dog count. So there is no plan for more recreation facilities or parks since the eventual buildout is still unknown.\u201dThe post also sees Darwin question the CDP\u2019s effect on the main arterial\u00a0 road, Albert Street, saying that the plan is \u201csilent on how wide it could or should be, and when it might reach that status.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe bridge has a speeding problem now, how will that be addressed?\u201d Kitchissippi Coun. Katherine Hobbs said she\u2019s pleased with the plan.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a shock sometimes to go from seeing 16 hectares of nothing to seeing a fully constructed neighborhood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe challenge is to make sure this enhances the surrounding neighborhoods in addition to meeting the needs of the city.\u201dThe design plan was first proposed in 2005 with the city looking to build on the light rail system, but was soon shelved due to the transit plan\u2019s cancellation by city council two years later. The concept was then redefined and proposed a second time, gaining approval in 2009. Planners envision the current Bayview transit station becoming \u201ca community landmark, enhanced with pedestrian and cycling access as well as more greenspace.\u201dFurther south, mixed-use buildings would be constructed to front onto the Somerset bridge in hopes of creating \u201cmore active street fronts\u201d and \u201can enriched pedestrian experience.\u201dMobility is also a concern for the planners, whose graphics \u2014 unveiled at a March 5 open house \u2014 detailed the aim to create more \u201cefficient, safer ways to navigate the area and surrounding neighborhoods.\u201dNew street designs will include new shared use and cycling lanes, with the plan also showing the installation of bicycle parking areas in high traffic areas.\u201cThese big parcels of land around Bayview station don\u2019t provide any sort of connectivity in terms of pathways, sidewalks, or even vehicular routes,\u201d explained Taavi Siitam, a community planner with the city\u2019s urban planning and design unit. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at the best way to create new streets and block sizes that are walkable. That can also provide pathways that go from one side of the O-Train tracks to the other, and go right across that big, empty, underutilized parcel.\u201dHobbs also praised the plan\u2019s emphasis on mobility.\u201cI like the idea that we have a lot of mobility built into this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about having people be able to move through this area that today we cannot get through effectively. I like that we\u2019re reclaiming this for our communities to use.\u201d Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes was unavailable for comment. Community members are still encouraged to provide feedback through the city, with the final CDP to be presented at a planning committee meeting on March 26.\u201cThe great thing about the knowledge that the community has is that they have already applied to the local locations they walk every single day,\u201d Siitam said. \u201cThey have a really good sense of where the refinements need to be made.\u201dSiitam said that light rail construction in the area should be completed by 2018.

    "body": "The former president of Centretown-based International Development Research Centre is now leading policy and research projects on the world stage as the head of the UN\u2019s own university. \r\rOttawa-born David Malone has just begun working from headquarters in Tokyo as the rector of United Nations University, a confederation of think-tanks with 15 different campuses and numerous affiliates around the world. He took up the position on March 1, also assuming the title of undersecretary-general of the UN. Although UNU does offer some academic courses, it functions more as an international research institution than a conventional university. Responding to questions via email, the 59-year-old Malone said part of his challenge will be finding the scarce funding dollars necessary to advance the UNU\u2019s research, as it\u2019s only the institution\u2019s base operations that have a stable source of revenue \u2013 investment income from an endowment fund. Malone says he enters the organization with several goals in mind. \u201cMy focus will be \u2013 relentlessly \u2013 on research and teaching quality,\u201d said the career diplomat, \u201cand our role in contributing to UN policy debates and decisions through evidence-based research.\u201dHe says he believes his five-year term as president of the government-funded IDRC has prepared him well for this position. The IDRC\u2019s mandate is to support and conduct research in the developing world to aid economic and social development. \u201cManaging the exciting team involved, and constantly focusing on how to make the most of our resources, has been excellent preparation for UNU,\u201d Malone said. The UNU\u2019s new rector says he\u2019ll bring a personal approach to directing research \u2013 by continuing to conduct it himself.\u00a0\u201cI hope this places me closer to those toiling in the research and policy advocacy trenches. High-quality research is not easy, and seeking to engage with it makes one more empathetic towards others who do,\u201d he said.\u00a0Balancing research and administration carry some advantages for Malone, says Bruce Currie-Alder, Malone\u2019s former chief of staff at the IDRC.\u201cIf you have experience \u2013 and continuing ongoing experience \u2013 in the substance of what the organization is about, that inevitably raises your credibility,\u201d Currie-Alder says.\u00a0Malone said he applied for the job after seeing a notice in The Economist. He\u2019s the first Canadian to take the position. Malone has an extensive history in international relations beyond his term at the IDRC, more recently having worked as Canada\u2019s high commissioner to India and non-resident ambassador to Bhutan and Nepal. News of his appointment in October received little play in the Canadian media. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fairly big deal, but it\u2019s hard to communicate,\u201d says Currie-Alder, adding that the UN is so large it\u2019s hard to emphasize the importance of specific positions. \u201cWe lost a Security Council seat,\u201d says Nipa Banerjee, an international development professor at the University of Ottawa. \u201cThis position is equivalent to the undersecretary-general\u2019s position at the UN. So that\u2019s great for Canada.\u201dYet Malone didn\u2019t secure the position because he was Canadian, says Currie-Alder. \u201cThis was based on merit. It wasn\u2019t based on flags,\u201d he says. Banerjee says Malone is \u201cquite well-known\u201d in diplomatic circles. \u201cHe\u2019s worked in many positions that require a high level of knowledge,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u00a0Despite his new international position, Malone says that he still identifies as Canadian. During his time at the IDRC he lived in the Golden Triangle area of Centretown. \u201cI was born in Ottawa, and always felt comfortable there, even though I grew up abroad in the Netherlands, Iran and France.\u201d Having moved with his parents while his father worked for then-Department of External Affairs, Malone was introduced to international affairs at an early age. \u201cTo live abroad a lot is to know how exceptionally blessed Canada is in so many ways, not least its well-functioning and inclusive society.\u201c ",

We are able to use real-time GPS data from OC Transpo, thanks to the City of Ottawa\u2019s Open Data Initiative, to create a customized display for the bus stops near any location in the city.\u201d OC Transpo\u2019s GPS data became available to the public last year, and Beyond 2.0\u2019s new screen is the first of it\u2019s kind in the city. The screens are able to map out exactly where a bus is on the roads, and their exact arrival time, all within approximately 60 seconds of accuracy, according to the website.Beyond 2.0\u2019s plan is to eventually install screens throughout the city, especially in more coffee shops, restaurants, and public areas where people can wait for the bus, according to the website. The idea is expected to be especially popular in the winter, when commuters are often left out cold at the bus stop with no indication of delays or cancellations. OC Transpo experienced massive, weather related delays and problems with buses getting stranded or stuck in the deep snow this winter. The major snowstorm that struck the capital at the end of February caused delays of more than 45 minutes, according to OC Transpo\u2019s Twitter feed. For certain commuters, the bus arrival screen is a solution that aims to relieve some of the frustration with bus delays. \u201cI think the bus arrival board is an excellent idea, and I\u2019d love to see it installed elsewhere,\u201d says daily OC Transpo user Madeleine Adams. Adams says OC Transpo was at the root of many of her delays and problems getting to work on time, especially during bad weather.\u00a0 Beyond 2.0 plans to submit their idea to Apps4Ottawa, a city - wide contest.

Key players in Centretown, such as health centres, businesses and community groups, need to join forces to tackle problem drinking, say experts, after an Ottawa Public Health report found one in four Ottawa adults over-consume alcohol weekly. \r\r\u201cIt really is about having everybody aware of how much is too much, and thinking about . . . the harms of alcohol and how we can prevent it,\u201d says Sherry Nigro, manager of health promotion and disease prevention for Ottawa Public Health. That includes physicians addressing the issue with patients, bartenders ensuring they don\u2019t over-serve alcohol and community health centres removing barriers to treatment, says Nigro. \u201cYou can do something differently if you\u2019re a business owner. You can do something a bit different if you\u2019re a health practitioner,\u201d says Nigro.The 2012 Substance Misuse Report, released on March 12, stated that alcohol leads to approximately 110 deaths, and 970 hospitalizations each year in Ottawa. It added that the proportion of Ottawa adults who over-consume alcohol has been higher than the provincial average since 2003. Another concern was that 73 per cent of young adult males, and 48 per cent of young adult females reported frequent binge drinking. Low-risk drinking guidelines from the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse say women should not exceed two drinks per day and 10 drinks per week. Men should have no more than three drinks per day and 15 drinks per week. Exceeding those limits can lead to short- and long-term health effects such as liver disease, heart disease, depression and unintentional injuries. Alcohol related injuries resulted in 323 hospitalizations in Ottawa last year. Those alarming numbers have caught experts\u2019 attention in Centretown, who say the community needs to start a discussion about problem drinking. \u201cI think that does involve bringing the business community together, the service industry . . . as well as social and health service organizations, and community associations to talk about this,\u201d says Jack McCarthy, the executive director of Somerset West Community Health Centre.Somerset West\u2019s primary focus is harm-reduction strategies for illegal drug use, but McCarthy says substance abuse, including alcohol misuse, needs to be addressed at the community-level. McCarthy says he thinks the next step is for local community associations to put this issue on their meeting agendas. He added that health services in Centretown, such as Somerset West, need to work with the Ottawa Board of Health to advise them on issues they see in the community. The report said Ottawa will focus on four pillars to tackle problem drinking. They are prevention, harm reduction, treatment and enforcement. Some of Ottawa Public Health\u2019s plans include promoting a culture of moderation in the city, and making it easier for people to get access to treatment programs. McCarthy says key players in communities such Centretown also need to address those four pillars. Prevention programs in high schools or new treatment centres are options that McCarthy says should be discussed.Experts say another option for the community is to have alternative nighttime activities for both youth and adults that don\u2019t involve drinking. That could mean encouraging theatres and galleries, for example, to stay open later or offer more events in the evening.It\u2019s all about \u201cexpanding the appeal and safety of a nighttime economy,\u201d says Gerald Thomas, a senior researcher for the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse. \u201cSo moving away from this sort of alcohol-centric version of what happens at night in cities, and expanding the businesses that are open, and expanding the menu of things to do after dark.\u201d Encouraging discussion like that, coupled with awareness about alcohol over-consumption, is key to tackling problem drinking, says Thomas.

Exceeding those limits can lead to short- and long-term health effects such as liver disease, heart disease, depression and unintentional injuries. Alcohol related injuries resulted in 323 hospitalizations in Ottawa last year. Those alarming numbers have caught experts\u2019 attention in Centretown, who say the community needs to start a discussion about problem drinking. \u201cI think that does involve bringing the business community together, the service industry . . . as well as social and health service organizations, and community associations to talk about this,\u201d says Jack McCarthy, the executive director of Somerset West Community Health Centre.Somerset West\u2019s primary focus is harm-reduction strategies for illegal drug use, but McCarthy says substance abuse, including alcohol misuse, needs to be addressed at the community-level. McCarthy says he thinks the next step is for local community associations to put this issue on their meeting agendas. He added that health services in Centretown, such as Somerset West, need to work with the Ottawa Board of Health to advise them on issues they see in the community. The report said Ottawa will focus on four pillars to tackle problem drinking. They are prevention, harm reduction, treatment and enforcement. Some of Ottawa Public Health\u2019s plans include promoting a culture of moderation in the city, and making it easier for people to get access to treatment programs. McCarthy says key players in communities such Centretown also need to address those four pillars. Prevention programs in high schools or new treatment centres are options that McCarthy says should be discussed.Experts say another option for the community is to have alternative nighttime activities for both youth and adults that don\u2019t involve drinking. That could mean encouraging theatres and galleries, for example, to stay open later or offer more events in the evening.It\u2019s all about \u201cexpanding the appeal and safety of a nighttime economy,\u201d says Gerald Thomas, a senior researcher for the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse. \u201cSo moving away from this sort of alcohol-centric version of what happens at night in cities, and expanding the businesses that are open, and expanding the menu of things to do after dark.\u201d Encouraging discussion like that, coupled with awareness about alcohol over-consumption, is key to tackling problem drinking, says Thomas.

After standing tall for 10 decades, St. Anthony\u2019s Church on Booth Street is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.\r\rThe church, known officially as St. Athony of Padua Roman Catholic Church, located in the heart of Little Italy, has always been a big part of the Italian community in Ottawa. Trina Constantini-Powell, president of St. Anthony\u2019s Ladies Aid, says the church has provided \u201ca home\u201d to Italian immigrants.\u201cMany of the Italian people who came here didn\u2019t know the language and didn\u2019t have jobs or friends here, but they could gather in the church and have a social base as well as a religious base. And that never stopped,\u201d she says.The church started celebrations last December and will continue throughout the year. Fr. Felix Loganathan, the church\u2019s pastor, says the celebrations include seminars about the frescos and stained glass windows of the church, a family picnic and a fundraiser.\u201cWe want people to be able to learn more about the church they go to, but also to reach out to new people,\u201d he says.The church is also creating a memory book. Constantini-Powell, who is in charge of the book, says it is very important to put the book together now, not just because of the anniversary, but also to ensure the history of the church isn\u2019t lost.\u201cThe people who have been going to this church for many, many years are getting older. If you don\u2019t capture the stories now, you\u2019re never going to get them. So we thought it was time to get them down on paper.\u201dThe memory book will be published at the end of the year.Evelyn St. Louis has been attending St. Anthony\u2019s since 1933 and still tries to go every Sunday. The 87-year-old now depends on family members to take her to the church, but that\u2019s not the only difference she has witnessed since she started attending.\u201cOne change that is very noticeable in the time I\u2019ve been going to this church is that it\u2019s not as full as it used to be. Lots of people don\u2019t go to church anymore. When I started going to this church it was always packed,\u201d St. Louis says.Loganathan agrees and says this is one of the reasons why parts of the anniversary celebrations focus on younger people, such as a youth mass and a walk-a-thon fundraiser.\u201cThere is a change of generations right now, so we are trying to reach out to the younger people and introduce them to the church,\u201d he says.St. Louis says she believes that reaching out to younger people is the right approach to keep the church alive.\u201cLots of parents don\u2019t take their kids to church anymore, so many kids don\u2019t even know what church is. Kids will have to be taught what it is in order to appreciate it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd how could they not? It\u2019s a beautiful church; it\u2019s a place of prayer and comfort.

The city is hoping to give Ottawa residents the ability to go online when they\u2019re out and about at certain city-run buildings. \r\rInternet might be coming to city hall, Jack Purcell Community Centre and Plant Recreation Centre as part of a plan to install wireless networks in 25 municipal facilities by the end of the year, says Beacon Hill-Cyrville Coun. Tim Tierney, chair of the information technology sub-committee. Citizens would no longer be limited by their data plans and Wi-Fi-only devices, and could go online during hockey practice, Tierney says.\u201cI coach hockey and I\u2019m at the rinks a lot and get that question from a lot of people, \u2018why can\u2019t we have Wi-Fi here?\u2019\u201d he says. It would give parents the ability to watch a video or check their email, for example, during practice, Tierney says.He says the only problem is the cost. On March 14, the city sent out a request to businesses asking for their proposal to outfit the 25 facilities with Wi-Fi, without the city having to spend a penny, except on electrical costs.\u201cWhoever the bidder is, is responsible for the complete system, so it won\u2019t cost the taxpayers any money,\u201d Tierney says. He added he thinks the city can leverage its assets, which are the buildings themselves, and in return the winning bidder could creatively use the buildings to generate revenue.While it is a great opportunity to work with the city, the cost burden is giving Storm Internet Services Inc. pause, says Dave Chiswell, CEO of the Ottawa-based company. Due to the extent of the city\u2019s request for installation and equipment, along with the challenges that come with outfitting 25 large buildings with Internet capabilities, Chiswell says he doesn\u2019t know how any creative financing, such as advertisements or paid-for Wi-Fi access, could cover the estimated minimum $100,000 in costs. \u201cFor a company of 40 people like Storm, that\u2019s a big number for us to absorb. That\u2019s why we\u2019re struggling with it right now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d love to be part of it, I just can\u2019t see the economics right now.\u201dAccording to the city\u2019s plan, the winning bidder must set up Wi-Fi access at the 25 facilities within six months of the contract start date. The city would require the winner to pay an exclusive Wi-Fi provider fee and share part the advertising revenue. If successful, the project would extend additional municipal facilities in groups of 25, and to transit services. All proposals for the project must be submitted by April 24, and Tierney says he hopes the project will be running by the end of the year. People are becoming more connected with the Internet all the time, and with the city\u2019s updated website and open data content, Wi-Fi service is the next evolution \u201cbringing us into the 21st century kicking and screaming,\u201d Tierney says. The project is one step among many helping Ottawa catch up with technological advances and become a leader among Canadian municipalities, Tierney says. \u201cIf people can be more productive in those off times, that\u2019s great news and reflects well on the city.\u201dStorm Internet provides Wi-Fi services to the Ottawa Bluesfest and Folk Festival, as well as to campsites and Barnabe\u2019s Independent Grocer in Perth. \u201cInternet is more than just reading and emails now. It's a source of entertainment, of doing ecommerce. It's a source of being informed. It's a source of providing an opinion. It\u2019s a source of networking with your friends,\u201d Chiswell says. The Internet has become the fourth most-used utility, he says, after water, electricity and plumbing. ",

    "body": "The location of the new Lord Stanley monument was announced last week, placing it on the popular and busy corner of Sparks and Elgin streets. However, doing so will displace its current occupant, a giant bronze sculpture of a grizzly bear. \r\rThe group behind the project, The Lord Stanley Memorial Monument Inc., has been searching for a location for the monument since 2009. The original site at Colonel By Drive and Rideau Street recently fell through and it looked to Sparks Street as the alternative. Despite the excitement over the new Stanley monument, many residents are opposed to the bear\u2019s forced change of habitat \u2013 and with good reason. For more than\u00a0 two decades, Canadian sculptor Bruce Garner\u2019s grizzly bear has been towering over pedestrians at the corner on Sparks and Elgin streets, delighting tourists and Ottawa residents alike. The bronze bear, suspended in motion while grasping at a salmon, was commissioned by Metropolitan Life Insurance and donated to the Sparks Street Mall in 1990. It has remained a signature piece of Sparks Street ever since. The statue, however, has more than just superficial importance. Named \u201cTerritorial Prerogative,\u201d it shows the importance of nature in Canada and of the respect we should accord the country\u2019s natural resources. The bear sits in the middle of the downtown core and it comes as a surprise to see four-metre tall animal alongside the cars and shops in the city. It is a reminder of what human urban growth has done to nature and the animal population. The message it represents and its arresting presence should be protected. The bear\u2019s sculptor, who died last October, never intended for the statue to be moved, according to his wife, Tamaya Garner. In an interview with the Ottawa Citizen, she said that the grizzly sculpture was installed with concrete and if it is relocated, \u201cit\u2019s going to be damaged.\u201d But this particular corner has some significance to the Lord Stanley monument due to its close proximity to the former Russell Hotel, present-day Confederation Square. It was in this hotel that it was announced that Lord Stanley would donate a cup to honour the Canada\u2019s winning hockey team. Although this history is important, the statue does not necessarily need to be right beside Confederation Square. The corner of Sparks and Metcalfe was a suggested location for the Stanley monument as well, and is also only a stone throw away from the square.Displacing the bear statue is not the right solution. There are many high-traffic, tourist areas in Ottawa that would be suitable for a monument to Lord Stanley, which won\u2019t be completed until 2017, according to the president of the Lord Stanley Memorial Monument Group Inc., Paul Kitchen.While this monument representing the history of Canada\u2019s favourite game will be an important symbol to Canadians, it shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of another equally important piece of art. Advocates for the Lord Stanley memorial should keep on searching and let the mama bear keep her home.",

    "body": "Does unpaid work with no vacation time and zero benefits sound appealing?\r\rIt likely doesn\u2019t. But for many young professionals, it certainly sounds familiar.It\u2019s no secret that students fresh out of university or college look for unpaid positions as a means to get their feet in the workforce door.Twenty per cent of 18 to 24 year-olds work, or have worked, as an unpaid intern, according to a study published by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Union of Students last year. The study also revealed almost 75 per cent of people in the same age range say internships are essential to build careers in media, whereas almost two-thirds say the same about politics, finance and fashion.But Ontario\u2019s Employment Standards Act doesn\u2019t even recognize unpaid interns as employees. This could be the reason why a November Statistics Canada survey found that almost 17 per cent of Ontarians between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed \u2013 up from 15 per cent in November 2011. Despite this, the province\u2019s overall unemployment rate is less than eight per cent.This is a dire situation for young people, which Yasir Naqvi, MPP for Ottawa Centre, should address as Ontario\u2019s newly minted labour minister. He should include unpaid internships under the Act, giving interns rights that every other employee in the province enjoys.Does working more than 48 hours in a week sound fair? What about not being entitled to a 30-minute food break once every five hours? Should an employer be able to fire those who\u2019ve worked more than three months without written notice?Perhaps most important is that those who hold these types of positions aren\u2019t entitled to the standard minimum wage of $10.25.How can anyone survive while working without any sort of compensation?\u201cYou really need help from your family,\u201d says Nick Bannard, who graduated with a film studies degree from Carleton University in April 2011. Three months later, he found an unpaid internship at a film company in Toronto.\u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t have that support, I think an unpaid internship would be very difficult and challenging in many ways,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would almost be a burden in terms of trying to get on your feet by renting an apartment and keeping your eyes open for paid work.\u201dFortunately for Bannard, his parents helped him with his move to Toronto and paid his rent. But he adds he still had to find part-time employment at a restaurant to earn spending money.Who could blame him? It took Bannard three unpaid internships over a span of more than a year to find paid work at a film public relations company in January. Unfortunately, his contract is only for a few months. This means he\u2019ll have to look for another job opportunity, which could even mean returning to unpaid work. It\u2019d be almost impossible to fund oneself for more than a year of these internships. Those without outside support are doomed to fail in their search for stable employment in their chosen field. If only young professionals with familial support can afford to compile impressive resumes, how can those without such benefits manage to compete?Employers won\u2019t consider hiring someone who\u2019s worked as a waiter for a couple of years compared with another applicant who has relevant experience.These aren\u2019t the only reasons why Naqvi should consider modifying the ESA to include unpaid internships. There are specific guidelines an unpaid internship must follow to be excluded from the act. For example, the Ontario Ministry of Labour says an employer should not benefit from having an unpaid intern. The benefit should weigh more favourably for the intern, as it\u2019s the employer\u2019s duty to act as a teacher and provide training through the duration of the internship. The ministry also states an employer can\u2019t promise a job at the end of the internship.But if unpaid internships stray from these guidelines, a worker probably won\u2019t take action against his or her employer. This allows employers to freely exploit young, unpaid labourers without much workplace knowledge.\u201cNew members of the workforce are particularly vulnerable. They may not know their rights, but they\u2019re also worried about creating a poor impression in the eyes of those who may employ them,\u201d says Michael Lynk, a labour law professor at Western University who used to practice in Ottawa. Interns may not earn money, but they want to gain something for their troubles: a reference letter or a future job. Legal action could jeopardize this. Does this mean Naqvi should abolish internships? No.Internships give young professionals a chance to prove themselves in the workplace and use what they\u2019ve learned in school. Undoubtedly, they need this experience because it may lead to a far more important role, which hopefully comes with a salary. The point is to make internships non-exploitative. Naqvi can accomplish this for Ontario if the ESA recognizes unpaid internships as a form of employment.",

Even more worrisome, about seven per cent considered suicide.These trends are indicative of an increase in suicides on university campuses across the country: after accidents suicide is the leading cause of death for youth 15 to 19, according to Statistics Canada.These figures are downright alarming and have resulted in a variety of organizations launching campaigns to reduce the stigma of mental health. After all, if you break your arm, it is common practice to visit the doctor. It should be no different for those with mental health issues.And it\u2019s youth in particular that are breaking this stigma and actively getting help. According to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, young people aged 15-24 are more likely to report mental illness than any other age group. Last year, Ryerson University\u2019s centre for student development and counseling saw a 200-per-cent increase in demand. What this increase should mean is that students actively reaching out about mental health issues are getting the counselling they need. But campus facilities are buckling under the demand. Wait times between intake forms and first appointments can be months.For students at the crux of a mental health problem, these waiting times are far too long. We need more counsellors and better facilities to accommodate them.Julia didn\u2019t like her first counsellor. She said she didn\u2019t listen well and continuously tried to diagnose her with a sleeping disorder rather than addressing mental health problems. After already waiting a month and a half for her first appointment, when she asked about seeing someone else, Julia was put back on the wait list. Julia then went off campus and inquired with Ottawa Family Services. They informed her of a nine-month wait to see a counsellor and recommended Jewish Family Services. She saw a counsellor there for four months.This year, Julia decided to give Carleton\u2019s services another try.Carleton University has three counsellors dedicated to residence students, a service Julia used in second year. She says the service was phenomenal. Unfortunately, once students move off-campus their support is reduced: four counsellors that share three counselling offices for more than 23,000 students and only one counsellor during the summer semester.\u201cThere\u2019s not enough facilities on campus for the amount of counsellors, and there\u2019s not enough counsellors on campus for the amount of students,\u201d says Julia.Campus facilities need to reflect this growing demand. Universities are working alongside mental health services to reduce the stigma. They\u2019re telling students to actively reach out for help. But the problem is that when they do reach out for help, they might not get it for months.Not all students will be as persistent as Julia. Wait times alone, can be discouraging enough for a student to not reach out again the next time around. ",

    "body": "Matthew Lee, Centretown NewsPeople will soon be able to buy e-books through the Ottawa Public Library. A decision by the Ottawa Public Library board that would see it start selling e-books won\u2019t put it in competition with the city\u2019s independent bookstores, says Jennifer Stirling, system wide services and innovation manager at the library. \r\rInstead, the library plans to work with publishers and independent or specialty bookstores by giving consumers the option of purchasing e-books directly from bookstores\u2019 websites.\u201cPart of the negotiations with publishers is to prove that we\u2019re working together. It\u2019s also to provide an alternate revenue stream for the library,\u201d says Stirling. She says the initiative could be a good opportunity for local book shops to get involved with the library\u2019s new venture. The library was reacting to a huge rise in its e-book usage. In 2012, 429,000 e-books were circulated by library users, up from 223,000 the year before.Sterling says once the e-book purchasing button is live on the library\u2019s website, the library is looking into the possibility that the customer will have the option of buying the e-book from a independent bookstore, via a link to its website from the library\u2019s website.\u201cPeople could choose between a local bookstore and another type of bookstore, as long as it meets the criteria and has the ability to provide the service,\u201d she says of the proposed service.\u201cOur website gets up to 95,000 hits per month . . . so I think the exposure to that would be very good . . . if they (the bookstores) have the technical infrastructure.\u201dDoug Sprunt, of Salem Storehouse a specialty religious bookstore on Merivale Road, is apprehensive about the plan.He says the initiative is questionable as most local, independent bookstores don\u2019t have e-book facilities and it\u2019s mostly larger national chains like Chapters that do.Sprunt says similar initiatives have been attempted in bookstores, but haven\u2019t been successful.He says he looked into setting up an e-bookstore for Salem Storehouse, but the program would cost $10,000 and the store would make just 50 cents profit on each book sold.\u201cI couldn\u2019t even imagine how many you\u2019d have to sell online and why would you come to a store to buy an e-book when most people just do it all on the Internet,\u201d he says of the library's proposed project.Peter Dawson, of independent bookstore Books on Beechwood, located on Beechwood Avenue, agrees that the board\u2019s decision isn\u2019t a positive move for the local bookstore industry.\u201cTo sell any kind of book is not competition that I like,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the public government competing with private industry.Michael Deyell, owner of specialty gay and lesbian bookstore After Stonewall on Bank Street, says he is unsure about the proposal and whether e-books have any relevance to his customers.\u201cI\u2019m not too sure what to say about it. All I know is that we have a loyal clientele; a lot of them like holding a book in their hands.\u201d\u201cPersonally, one of the reasons I bought After Stonewall is because I am an avid reader. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever incorporate them into the business,\u201d Deyell says. But he acknowledges the undeniable impact that e-books and the Internet are having. \u201cI know things like Amazon have really hurt a lot of independent bookstores, and a lot have closed because of this and people downloading books, and I think it could start hurting a lot of bookstores if other businesses were to do that,\u201d Deyell says.The library board\u2019s meeting in February voted in favour of installing a \u2018buy\u2019 button to the library\u2019s website, allowing consumers to purchase e-books from the library. The system is still being formulated with publishers, but library administrators expect the plan to be implemented by no later than the middle of the year.",

    "body": "Late last month, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer announced her company would be putting an end to any work-from-home agreements it had with its employees. \r\rIn a company-wide memo, Mayer told her workers that as of June, it would be mandatory for them to report to the office on a daily basis. Throughout the business world, be it in large international corporations down to smaller businesses, the trend has been to increase employee freedom and flexibility. This makes Mayer\u2019s announcement not only seem against the grain but downright archaic. Indeed, the loudest responses to the announcement have been from those who see the move as anti-progressive. Sir Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group and a man who knows a thing or two about running a business, has been the heaviest hitter. In a blog post a few days after the news, Branson wrote: \u201cMany employees who work from home are extremely diligent, get their job done, and get to spend more time with their families. They waste less time commuting and get a better work-life balance. To force everybody to work in offices is old school thinking.\u201d The British billionaire went so far as to say that with the pace of technology, in 30 years people will look back and wonder why offices even existed. That's not to suggestw that Mayer\u2019s decision is entirely without merit. In her memo she says \u201csome of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and impromptu team meetings. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home. We need to be one Yahoo, and that starts with physically being together.\u201dWhile the argument makes sense it neglects the fact that times have changed. A whole new generation of employees is no longer satisfied with a rigid, clock in-clock out, sit in a cubicle and suffer through commuter traffic, kind of job. The effects of burn-out, low office morale and the increased benefits of working from home have been well documented and the call for change has been so strong it has sparked its own industry called \u2018work-shifting\u2019.IT companies are now specialising in helping other companies shift from a traditional office to a more flexible work-from-anywhere network. Fuelled Networks, a Kanata based IT firm, is leading the way in the Ottawa area. In an article on the issue, Ernie Sherman, the company\u2019s president, says that a balance between work and life is a priority for most employees.\u201cThe ability to allow your top team members to fulfill this goal in their life will help in getting your best employee\u2019s engaged and keep them around for a long time,\u201d he wrote. Sherman notes that security issues have hindered companies from making the leap in the past but with recent technological advancements in the field. He says companies can rest easy knowing employees can work and share company information from anywhere securely. According to a 2010 Statistics Canada report, around 3.6 million Canadians had the luxury of working from home. That number has surely grown in the past few years with Canadian companies such as Telus having as many as 50 per cent of their employees work from outside the office. The company even has a goal to have that raised to 70 per cent by 2015. A recent U.S. study found that one in five Americans works from home and that number is expected to grow by as much as 63 per cent in the next five years.Numbers like these show that allowing employees to work from outside the office has been on the rise for a reason. Because it works: It\u2019s cheaper for companies who can cut down on office space, reduces their carbon footprint by eliminating commuting and allows companies to attract creative, young talent who feel stifled by a traditional office setting.Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s fifth CEO in four years, is living dangerously indeed if she hopes her company can buck the trend.

Members of Ottawa\u2019s skateboard community want to make sure municipal officials hear their call for new city facilities and rules for their sport.\r\rRepresentatives from the Centretown store Antique Skateshop and the Ottawa skaters it serves had plans to march this week from the Florence Street shop to nearby McNabb Park. They're telling the city they want a new outdoor skateboard park installed there as part of a green-space redevelopment spearheaded by Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes.The proposed McNabb Park skate ramps are just one of the issues being raised by Antique\u2019s staff and clients, says store owner Aaron Cayer. Since the business opened last March, they\u2019ve also been lobbying the city for an indoor skate park somewhere in Ottawa.Adam Warzynczak, one of Antique\u2019s team riders, says the store\u2019s owners run bus trips to Montreal so Ottawa\u2019s skaters can use an indoor facility in that city.Cayer says skateboarding advocates are also asking the city to overturn a bylaw introduced in 2009 that says graffiti on ramps in skateboard parks is legal.Cayer, who also serves as a representative on the Ottawa Skateboard Community Association, says the store has given the community a new face.\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this type of activism for more than 10 years,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving a name and an organized group gives us a lot more credibility than just a couple guys out on the street.\u201dCayer says the group\u2019s campaign for an indoor park is strongly backed by Ottawa\u2019s young skateboarders, who are going to great lengths to be able to skate in the winter.He says they\u2019ve been skating inside schools and indoor parking lots, and he\u2019s even seen kids shovelling snow off of skateboard ramps at the city\u2019s outdoor parks.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t see kids out shovelling baseball diamonds,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s just something more to this activity that\u2019s really driving kids.\u201dCayer says there\u2019s already been response from the city. He says Kitchissippi Coun. Katherine Hobbs has expressed interest in having an indoor facility in her ward, and he\u2019s heard from several councillors who want to see the graffiti bylaw overturned.Warzynczak says the people behind Antique have great passion for the sport, and that\u2019s helped the Ottawa skateboard community accept them with open arms.\u201cYou could ask any skater in Ottawa, and they would probably say Antique is a cornerstone in the skateboarding community . . . We\u2019ve become such an important part of the community.\u201dHe says Cayer brought his passion for skateboarding with him when he opened the store. He says the activism and involvement is what makes Antique so special for the city.\u201cIt sets us apart from (other stores) in the city, if not the country.\u201dThe store\u2019s manager, Kyle Robertson, says staff members don\u2019t treat the shop like store, but like a hub for the community.\u201cIt\u2019s not like Antique alone is doing (the activism). We don\u2019t care what store you shop at,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIf we all make more noise . . . we\u2019ll come out on top.\u201dCayer was hoping to make a lot of noise on the march to McNabb Park near Bronson and Gladstone avenues. The city has already committed about $1 million to revamping the park.He said the goal was to get 200 people to march in hopes of showing the city how passionate Ottawa\u2019s skateboarders are about their favourite activity.\u201cWe\u2019re getting these kids involved in the political process over something they believe in at a very young age.\u201d ",

Dr. Carolyn Pim, an Ottawa Public Health physician in charge of community health protection, says the issue of infection prevention and control has become more of a priority in the past couple of years.\u201cWe have something called the Ontario Public Health standards which require us to do inspections of personal-service settings, and this is fairly new,\u201d she says. She added that as OPH gets more involved in the issue, it\u2019s looking to develop a more comprehensive approach. A key challenge is the high number of personal-service businesses that pop up without being noticed.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know where all of these facilities are,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no mechanism for us to be informed when a new one pops up.\u201dPim also says that OPH relies heavily on public health inspectors to discover new shops that might need inspecting both while travelling around the city and through Internet searches since there\u2019s no licensing process for personal-service businesses.Greg Boulanger, a tattoo artist at the Ink Spot on Bank Street, says mandatory licensing for tattoo parlours and related businesses would go a long way to stopping the spread of disease and preserve reputations of legitimate sites.\u201cEverything that they (OPH) tell us to do, we\u2019re right on the ball,\u201d says Boulanger, pointing to people advertising their services on the Kijiji and Craigslist websites as the potential rogues within the industry. \u201cSome people have shops open that shouldn\u2019t be tattooing,\u201d he says, noting that those kinds of operations are unable to maintain the high standards of sanitation necessary. Pim says the OPH is exploring a licensing system based on systems in cities such as Toronto and Montreal.She added that regulating these businesses would benefit the owners because it would allow the city to help educate managers and employees on the best ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The motion calls for a full report on improving\u00a0 strategies for infection prevention and is to be presented before the end of the year.",

Five per cent of employers expect to make cutbacks to their payroll, while 75 per cent plan on maintaining their current staffing level.

Ottawa is not ready to adapt to the rapidly aging population in its suburban and rural areas, which could further burden already encumbered services in the city centre, say old-age service providers. \r\rIn the next two decades, more seniors will be living outside Ottawa\u2019s central areas than within, a reversal of the current demographics, according to the city\u2019s Older Adult Plan 2012-2014. As baby boomers already living in these areas age without sufficient senior services close to home, they may have to travel into the city for them, says Cathy Jordan, executive director of the Western Ottawa Community Resource Centre. \u201c(Improving) transportation is one of our biggest issues, to be able to take seniors down to, say, the Civic Hospital for repeated visits like for physiotherapy or cancer treatments,\u201d she says. Anne Kendall, community support services co-ordinator at the Good Companions Seniors\u2019 Centre, says seniors usually move closer to the city for more convenient access to amenities such as grocery stores and transportation. While the Good Companions is based in Centretown, it provides various community services for seniors in the suburbs in northeast Ottawa as well as downtown, she says. Meanwhile, those who cannot afford to move and cannot access services nearby will have to commute to the city. Not only does this put more pressure on hospitals and acute health care services, it creates challenges for seniors. \u201cYou want to stay at home because you\u2019ve always lived in a rural area but your services are downtown, like the hospitals and outpatient care,\u201d says Dominique Paris-MacKay, who is leading the Age Friendly Ottawa initiative to make the city more accessible to seniors at the Council on Aging of Ottawa. Seniors are Ottawa\u2019s fastest growing population segment as the baby boomers reach ages 65 and older. The number of seniors living in Ottawa will more than double over the next two decades, according to the city\u2019s report.The city has several issues to address in accommodating seniors, says Paris-MacKay. For example, there is a lack of affordable housing for seniors with safety features such as minimal stairs and grab bars in the washrooms. Information about services needs to be more accessible as well, she says. Ottawa has a variety of services available, including those supporting aging at home, but seniors don\u2019t know where or how to access them. There also needs to be more programs addressing multicultural and multilingual seniors, as well as LGBTQ seniors, Kendall says. Discussions about these challenges have become louder as Ottawa\u2019s age-friendly efforts come under international scrutiny over the next few years. Ottawa is trying to join the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Network of Age-friendly Cities and Communities, which connects cities to share ways to better meet seniors\u2019 needs. \u201cIt\u2019s about thinking about ways that we can adapt our environment, our policies, our services to an aging population,\u201d Paris-MacKay says.The WHO recently accepted Ottawa\u2019s application. The city has consulted with seniors and must submit a joint action plan on age-friendliness with the Council on Aging of Ottawa by the end of the year, Paris-MacKay says. After a three-year monitoring period, the WHO will decide whether or not to officially recognize Ottawa.Ottawa became interested in the network in 2009, but there are already over 500 Canadian cities and small communities involved with the network. So far, the WHO has recognized Edmonton, Waterloo, London, Saanich in B.C., and Welland, Ont., as age-friendly cities. ",

Ottawa Police say there were seven reported collisions involving pedestrians on Bank, Elgin and Kent streets between Catherine and Wellington streets in both 2010 and 2011. The numbers for 2012 have not yet been released. Stephen Thirlwall, a member of the CCCA seniors committee, says awareness needs to take place \u2013 for both drivers and pedestrians. He adds the education will be a gradual process.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to change the habits of people. If they\u2019re going to jaywalk, they\u2019re going to jaywalk unless they get a really hard scare themselves,\u201d he says.

However, she says those who are frail typically are driven to the centre instead of walking to it. Bridgewater says the slower speeds on Bank Street also help keep seniors safe.

Component 3 includes 100 hours of international experience through a student exchange, studying abroad or local activities with a strong focus on international relations.Ottawa is already home to an international studies program known as the International Baccalaureate.

The city is working on a new development that may solve some issues regarding cross-city cycling routes and parking on Laurier Avenue.\r\rSomerset Coun. Diane Holmes says the city is in negotiations with the Ottawa Carleton District School Board to build a bikeway through the former property of the Ottawa Technical High School on Albert Street. The city and the school board passed a plan five years ago in which the city will give the school board buildings on the east side of the property, in return for green space on the west side, where a bikeway would be built, Holmes says.Michael Clarke, superintendent of facilities at the school board, confirms that the city has approached the OCDSB about its desire to create a cycling path through the property.Holmes says the plan is to have the bikeway travel across Laurier through what is currently a parking lot at Percy Street, down near Albert and Slater, along the transit way and through the school\u2019s green space, ending at Bronson Avenue. It may be years before the school board decides to sell the land, though the city hopes it will be granted right of way over the land to go ahead with the plans, Holmes says.With the bikeway, Holmes says she is expecting to see some of the parking space restored on Laurier after it was removed for the segregated bike lanes.The city took away all of the parking along Laurier from Lyon to Bronson which was visitor parking for the condos there, Holmes says. The Bay/Bronson Resident\u2019s Action Group for Fair Access to the Road has opposed the segregated lane for just this reason.Janine Hutt, president of the group, says the needs of the residential people were not taken into consideration, leaving thousands inconvenienced and without parking.Hutt says Laurier is the wrong street for segregated lanes because of the heavy commercial traffic.The proposed bikeway is certainly not a direct response to the parking issue, Hutt says. \u201cI still have trouble visualizing how this bikeway will make the residential area more amenable to parking,\" says Hutt. Holmes says the bike path will make it easier to return parking on Laurier from Percy to Bronson.Holmes says the bikeway will also add to existing cross-city cycling routes, hoping at some point the bikeway will connect down to the River Parkway. The absence of links coming into downtown for cyclists to get across the city is a significant problem, says Alex deVries vice-president of Citizens for Safe Cycling.\u201cThe path through the Ottawa Technical High School is going to make that a lot nicer,\u201d says deVries. Robert Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, says his organization fully supports this bikeway.Dekker says there is an increased demand for bikeways like this because of people commuting to work downtown.\u201cAnything that alleviates that demand from the major routes is a good thing,\u201d Dekker says.The bikeway could also reinforce the area as green space and eliminate any chance of developments on the property, Dekker says. Clarke says the plan does mention that a portion of the property\u2019s space will remain a park.The proposal is still in discussion and the school board is continuing to work with the city to make sure all needs are met, Clarke says. As for what stage the proposal is currently in, Holmes says, \u201cthere\u2019s a concept plan, but certainly no final design.\u201dBut Holmes says she hopes it can be done sooner rather than later. \u201cIt would be wonderful if it could happen this spring, but it\u2019s really up to the school board.\u201d",

His pictures show indigenous communities reeling from violence in Peru, as well as those impacted by tar sands development in Alberta holding up banners in protest. \r\rThese photographs of native resistance are showcased in Create This Revolution, a new exhibition at Gallery 101 that runs until April 13. Billed as a \u201cflash mob art show,\u201d Create This Revolution features many works inspired by Idle No More. That movement hit a chord with many in the artistic community, says Laura Margita, director and curator of Gallery 101.\u201cArtist-run centres, historically, are about revolutions in terms of creative freedom, (where) people who are often marginalized have a place to show their art,\u201d Margita says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people, especially in the indigenous communities, who haven\u2019t been idle, but it\u2019s a question of empowering them.\u201dPowless\u2019s series of photos is entitled We Rise to Mother Earth. A member of the Indigenous Environmental Network and a Mohawk from Six Nations in Ontario, Powless says he started taking photographs to support the activism he was involved with. Two of his featured pictures show rallies on Parliament Hill in support of Sisters in Spirit, an initiative started by families of missing and murdered Aboriginal women to raise awareness for that issue. One photograph shows a peaceful march by the Alberta tar sands, where several First Nations communities came together to offer healing to the land and ask for the destruction to stop.\u201cA lot of people are getting sick these days,\u201d Powless says, concerning the indigenous communities in Northern Alberta most affected by the tar sands. \u201cWe\u2019ve always needed someone on our own side to document everything . . . especially with the rise of social media, to get those things out there to the general public.\u201dThe catalyst for Powless\u2019s photojournalism began when he went to Peru in 2009. During his stay, native Amazonian tribes were protesting the Peruvian government over new laws that would have sold parts of their tribal land. After two months of protest, armed police went to clear protesters from the area near Bagua, Peru. When the police broke down a blockade, the two sides clashed, leaving more than 30 dead, including nine tribesmen.Powless accompanied chiefs and members of the media to Bagua and snapped several photographs of the devastated native community. He says the press did a poor job of reporting the aftermath in the natives\u2019 perspective.\u201cThat, for me, was a really powerful moment in my own life, of really realizing the power and the necessity of visuals to communicate some of these stories . . . especially from indigenous communities who rarely have their stories shared and told,\u201d Powless says.Create This Revolution also features sculpture, painting, video and performance art from both emerging and established Canadian artists. Gallery 101 has become one of Ottawa\u2019s largest centres for Aboriginal and Inuit art in recent years. Margita says exhibiting art with an activist purpose can expose Ottawa residents to various social and political issues.\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s easier to understand (issues) if you\u2019ve got an art gallery and something beautiful to go and see,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes the message more poignant.\u201dOne of the emerging artists, Alan Harrington, got a call from Margita after he posted a photograph on Facebook that he took on Parliament Hill in January. The picture, named \u201cPower of the Jingle,\u201d shows an elder woman from Wiki in a jingle dress holding her family staff. A jingle dress is a ceremonial dress for First Nations that represents healing people when they are sick. In the photograph, women draped in the jingle dress stand, solemn, around the elder. The dress originated from the Whitefish Bay First Nation in Northwestern Ontario, where a father was told in a dream to create the dress to cure his ailing daughter. When the young girl, Maggie White, wore the jingle dress and started dancing, she got better.\u201cWomen in our cultures are very strong and they do have the power with the jingle,\u201d says Harrington, who is Ojibwe. \u201cWhen they dance, it is a healing dress. When they came (to Parliament Hill), it was to start healing\u2026 for everybody in Canada and all parts of the world because Mother Earth is hurting.\u201dHarrington has taken photographs as a hobby for six years, but says he decided to document moments of the Idle No More movement whenever he could. Create This Revolution is his first exhibit. \u201cIf it\u2019s for a good cause, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Harrington says.Beyond taking photographs, Powless says that he will continue to be an activist. He works for many indigenous organizations, such as Defenders of the Land, which connects native communities who protest government legislation to take up the cause together.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of groups that have never been idle,\u201d Powless says.

Earlier this month, Robert Menzies, president of local production company Zed Filmworks, told 1310 News and the Ottawa Sun that his business already has seven projects booked for this summer.\r\rThe sunny projections match comments that Genevi\u00e8ve M\u00e9nard-Hayles, the city\u2019s film and television commissioner, made to the Ottawa Citizen in January. M\u00e9nard-Hayles told the paper that she wants to make the Ottawa film office more efficient and that she supported local development organization Invest Ottawa\u2019s plans to bring a sound stage to the city. Plans to build the facility seem to have fallen through after the Toronto company involved in the project backed out last month. Still, everywhere you turn, the city\u2019s film industry is selling Ottawa to producers as an attractive place to shoot a movie.But sifting through articles about these production plans, it feels like one thing is constantly getting lost in all the numbers. Movies are an art form and focusing too much on the business side of things loses sight of the fact that they offer a chance to express something about the city in a meaningful way.That\u2019s not to say that attracting foreign interest and investment is a bad thing. Far from it; money that goes into the industry will invariably be used to help the film community grow. In turn, this will give local filmmakers more opportunities to develop their work. But it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the idea that Ottawa should be focused on courting outside interest instead of helping its own artists grow.Indeed, the 1310 News interview with Menzies ends by teasing that Hollywood stars could be coming to Ottawa. Not to be outdone, the Sun lists the various celebrities who\u2019ve shot films in the capital, including recent Academy Award-winner Jennifer Lawrence and past nominee Elisabeth Shue.The glamour of Tinseltown is exciting, but it\u2019s a passing thrill. Ultimately, the fact that these stars come through town doesn\u2019t say much about Ottawa as a film scene. It suggests it\u2019s a nice place to shoot, maybe, but not necessarily a hotbed for creativity.As if to drive the point home, the Ottawa Citizen reports that \u201cWe Work Ottawa,\u201d a new video from BigTime Productions and ACTRA Ottawa, will feature a cameo from comedian Dan Aykroyd in an effort to promote the use of local actors. Again, this is a nice gesture, but it sends the message that a big star from out of town has to sell Ottawa actors. The talent should speak for itself, rather than let a celebrity do the talking.In addition to courting outside interest, more should be done to develop local creativity. Organizations such as the Independent Filmmakers Co-Operative of Ottawa have already received funding from the province and the city, but it ought to be promoted more. A membership provides valuable experience and equipment for budding filmmakers.Supporting local talent goes even further than that, though. It means fostering a sense of civic pride in our film artists, and helping unique viewpoints shaped by living in the city itself make it to the screen. Why disguise Ottawa as somewhere else? Why not bring it into clearer focus and put it front and centre?",

Since 411 Dramaturgy was awarded the coveted Rubber Chicken award as champions, they\u2019ve been busy making a mark in Ottawa\u2019s theatre scene.\r\rTheir show is Hip Hop Shakespeare Live Music Videos. It showed last June at the Ottawa Fringe Theatre Festival and was received positively, says Melanie Karin, artistic director for 411 Dramaturgy. The show recently wrapped up a two-week run at the Great Canadian Theatre Company. It tells the stories of Shakespeare by remixing them with songs from popular rap artists like Kanye West and Jay-Z.The Ottawa theatre scene is taking notice of 411 Dramaturgy, says Al Connors, a member of Ottawa\u2019s Company of Fools. The Fools largely produce Shakespeare-inspired performances and Connors says it was fantastic to see 411 Dramaturgy remix the Bard with popular hip-hop.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re always looking for a way to get engaged with other theatre companies,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019ve definitely made it known that they are here to do some great work.\u201d411 Dramaturgy is different from other theatre companies in Ottawa. Dramaturgy itself is a collaborative script and production development process. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially just making a show better based on knowledge and research,\u201d says Karin.Karin works directly with local playwrights to help them get their scripts ready for performance. One of those playwrights is David Whiteman. He has been working with 411 Dramaturgy for about a year on his play, The Lights of Shangri-La.The input from Karin, 26, is particularly valuable to Whiteman, who is in his 50s, he says. An Ottawa theatre company will produce his play in 2014.411 Dramaturgy is also active in developing youth theatre, says Karin. She worked as a playwright and dramaturgy mentor at Ottawa\u2019s Youth Infringement Festival last year and says she plans on doing the same this year.In the near future, 411 Dramaturgy wants to tour Hip Hop Shakespeare Live Music Videos around local high schools, says Karin. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a tough sell at the moment because, as it stands, we don\u2019t really have a censored version,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of swearing.\u201d",

Local Anglicans have organized a benefit piano recital in Iqaluit featuring world-renowned Ottawa pianist Angela Hewitt, an event intended to raise funds for the newly consecrated St. Jude\u2019s Anglican Cathedral.\r\rThe igloo-shaped cathedral was originally built in the capital of Nunavut in 1972, but was demolished following a large fire that consumed the church in November 2006.Members of Christ Church Cathedral in Centretown spearheaded the effort to help raise funds so the northern church could be reconstructed on an even bigger scale, says Frances Macdonnell, a former organist and choir director at Christ Church.Rebuilding the cathedral, which is the largest enclosed space in the eastern Arctic, was a painstaking task, Macdonnell says. She explained that all building materials had to be flown or shipped in.The congregation at Christ Church has played a major role in the renovation of St. Jude\u2019s. Since Ottawa is one of the few cities with a direct flight to Iqaluit, the two churches have formed a strong connection over the years, according to Garth Hampson, one of the main fundraisers for the renovation. Hampson, a former staff sergeant with the RCMP, says his postings in the north gave him a greater appreciation for Inuit life.\u201cI\u2019m amazed at how they can handle everything and live off the land,\u201d Hampson says. \u201cThis was just my way of giving back, because they\u2019re very close to their faith up there.\u201dAfter the 2006 fire, the members of Christ Church Cathedral organized the national fundraising effort to rebuild St. Jude\u2019s.\u201cThat cathedral carried a lot of dreams of Canada, so people from all across Canada have been helping to raise money,\u201d Macdonnell says.The total cost of rebuilding the church was approximately $9.3 million, with more than $6 million raised through donations and fundraising, says Edward Picco, the chairman of fundraising at the St. Jude\u2019s parish.The benefit piano recital on June 7 is going to be a major post-construction fundraising event for the church, according to Macdonnell.Hewitt, who learned to play piano at Christ Church, where her father was an organist for 50 years, will take a break from her international tour to perform at the Iqaluit cathedral, Hampson says.Hewitt said in an email that she was very happy to be going to Iqaluit to perform the benefit recital.\u201cIt has always been a dream to visit the far north of Canada, and this seemed the perfect occasion,\u201d Hewitt said.She said she heard about St. Jude\u2019s and the rebuilding through Macdonnell and Hampson.\u201c(Hewitt) was very interested, and so I said off the top of my head, \u2018You know after it\u2019s rebuilt, you should go up there and play a concert,\u2019\u201d Macdonnell recalls.\u201cIt is a magnificent venue for this type of event and her volunteering her time to support the fundraising for St. Jude\u2019s is tremendous,\u201d Picco said via email.Hewitt explained that music is a great way of communicating with people, and she is happy to help out the community in this way.Hewitt will perform on a Kawai piano, which was donated to St. Jude\u2019s by an anonymous donor from Edmonton after the cathedral\u2019s original organ was destroyed in the fire.People will be coming from all over the world to see Hewitt play at Iqaluit, Hampson says. In a church that holds 450 people, he said he expects a standing room-only event.\u201cWe won\u2019t know until after the concert how much money has actually been raised, but it will be a substantial amount, thousands and thousands of dollars,\u201d Macdonnell says.",

The National Arts Centre is hoping to attract a wider audience by making the orchestra experience more comfortable in its new three-concert Casual Fridays series.\r\rWhen planning its 2013-14 season, the NAC wanted to reach out to people who don\u2019t regularly attend orchestra concerts, says Natalie Rumscheidt, senior marketing officer for the NAC Orchestra. The NAC created Casual Fridays after learning more about why certain demographics, such as younger audiences, aren\u2019t attending performances, she says. To bring these people into the concert hall, the NAC is breaking the mould of the traditional night at the orchestra. Most noticeably, the NAC is encouraging guests to dress casually during the three Casual Friday concerts, Rumscheidt says. Although the NAC doesn\u2019t have an official dress code, most people dress up for performances. This may be scaring people away, she says.\u201cSome people are looking for an easier or more accessible way to learn how to appreciate this art form,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is what Casual Fridays is all about \u2013 making a fun, social, and engaging evening and giving a little bit more depth in the learning experience.\u201d This depth comes from constant engagement between the audience and what\u2019s happening on stage, Rumscheidt says. In normal orchestra performances there may be discussions with a host before or after the concert to give the audience more understanding of the music, she says. On Casual Fridays, this conversation continues throughout the entire performance, Rumscheidt says. The engagement is meant to give those with no knowledge of the orchestra better insight and appreciation of classical music, she says.Casual Fridays are also shorter than a traditional concert, clocking in at exactly 90 minutes from beginning to end. The series has an early 7 p.m. start time to attract commuters who work downtown along with younger people with later plans, Rumscheidt says. And, with only three performances \u2013 one this November along with concerts in March and June 2014 \u2013 there is less of a commitment for those who buy the ticket package. Although Casual Fridays changes some things, the music won\u2019t be different than any other night. The concerts in the series are condensed, but they feature the same works, conductors and musicians as the concerts that happen on the Thursday night before Casual Fridays, Rumscheidt says.The series will bring in a new audience because it breaks down barriers for guests, says Amanda Forsyth, principal cellist with the NAC Orchestra. \u201cYou can go to a concert and still be relaxed,\u201d Forsyth says. The NAC isn\u2019t the first group in Ottawa to learn that a casual atmosphere can encourage a wider range of guests.Music and Beyond, a classical music festival, found that letting the audience wear shorts and tank-tops to summer concerts created a more inclusive atmosphere for those who are intimidated by classical music, says Julian Armour, artistic director of the festival.\u201cThey\u2019re afraid that they won\u2019t know how to dress, when to clap, or how to understand the music,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a really big step to say it\u2019s ok to dress casually, and people respond to that really well.\u201d Forsyth is the daughter of celebrated composer Malcolm Forsyth. She will be debuting his double concerto at the NAC on March 7, 2014, the second concert in the series. She says he would be thrilled that Casual Fridays is encouraging a younger audience to enjoy classical music. \u201cThe new generation is what will make anything live on, but they have to know about it,\u201d she says.

The festival will feature the work of 250 artists from Northern areas. It begins on April 25 and will run for 10 days at 26 venues across Ottawa and Gatineau.This is the festival\u2019s 10th year and, according to the NAC, this time around the Scene Festival will be the largest gathering of artists from the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut to ever meet outside the region. Some of the best-known acts will include singer-songwriter Sarah MacDougal, a Yukon native, and the circus troupe Artcirq. The festival will kick off with an art gallery crawl by bus through the city, followed by an opening night party, featuring a high-fashion runway and stage show with Nunavut throatboxing star Nelson Tagoona as the main attraction. There will also be art for sale.Artists hoping to make connections will have a chance to meet informally with dozens of art agents, promoters and gallery owners. A circus spectacle at the Canadian Museum of Civilization on April 30 will feature Artcirq, a group founded in the small town of Igloolik, Nunavut. They represented the Canadian North in front of the Queen as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations last summer.Heather Moore, producer of Northern Scene, says audiences should be excited.\u201cIt\u2019s a very contemporary look at a snapshot of what\u2019s going on in the arts and culture world in the North, and a chance for audiences of the South to understand a different region through the artists and their work,\u201d she says.She adds that the NAC tries to show the true Northern arts scene.\u201cWe do a lot of watching and talking to really get a handle on what truly is the Northern Scene,\u201d Moore says. \u201cWe try to travel as much as possible to make sure it\u2019s not Ottawa\u2019s view of what the north is.\u201dShe adds that the festival is coming at an important time for Canada.\u201cThe Scene Festivals have been working their way across the country.

It already has seven features scheduled to be filmed in Ottawa.\r\r\u201cOttawa is a hidden gem for a number of reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have great crews, actors and locations here.\u201dMenzies says his production company films in Centretown regularly. The area often doubles as a different city, he says, such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago or Philadelphia. Menzies says they frequently film in hotels and restaurants downtown. In 2011, they had to temporarily close Metcalfe Street to film Penthouse North, a movie starring Michael Keaton slated for release later this year. \u201cIt may be a little disruptive, but everyone embraced it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe respect our city. We also employ a lot of people and spend a lot of money. In the five years that Zed has been around, I have never heard any complaints.\"Last year was Ontario\u2019s strongest ever in the film and television industry, reported the Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport earlier this month. The industry contributed $1.28 billion to the provincial economy in 2012 and accounted for almost 29,000 full-time direct and indirect jobs. Economic activity in this sector has increased by 90 per cent since 2008.\u201cOntario has a great tax credit incentive, it\u2019s competitive on a world basis,\u201d says Menzies. \u201cIt makes Canada a great production centre. B.C. has been retracting their tax credit, and as a result their film industry is suffering.\u201dMenzies credits Ottawa\u2019s \u201cfilm-friendly\u201d mayor, Jim Watson, and Invest Ottawa, an economic development organization, for the increasing growth in the city\u2019s film industry.In 2011, Watson announced that film and television would become an economic development priority, after seeing the industry generate on average $20 million locally each year, Stephanie Davy, co-ordinator of the film office at Invest Ottawa, said in an email. \u201cAs a result, a new film office was created with the added resources, financial and human, to increase the economic impacts of film and TV,\u201d she said. \u201cThe industry\u2019s growth can also be attributed to the production companies that attract Hollywood type movies to the city.\"Michael Dobbin, film producer and director of Quiet Revolution Pictures Inc., produces movies in Ottawa. He was a major bidder in an effort to help Invest Ottawa bring a film and television studio to the Bayview Yards. However, after Toronto-based Cinespace backed out, Invest Ottawa plans to cancel the project.Despite the setback, Dobbin says Ottawa makes for an ideal location to shoot movies.\u00a0\u201cThe quality of life here is so good. It\u2019s a place I love to live in, so it is an easy sell for foreign partners who come to work here,\u201d he says.

    "body": "On a hot summer\u2019s day in Ottawa, you can practically see the streets sizzling.\r\rThe temperature increase in urban areas due to heat radiating off concrete is known as the heat-island effect. Ottawa Public Health, using satellite imagery, has started a project to map parts of the city that feel the worst of it. Buildings, sidewalks and roads radiate heat much more than green areas, so temperatures can climb by up to three degrees Celsius in those places during the day and 12 degrees Celsius at night.University of Ottawa graduate Peter Keizer is working on the mapping project. In addition to identifying hot spots in town, he\u2019s looking at what other cities have done, and at what solutions there are for city planning in the future.\u201cWe\u2019re wanting to know how the most vulnerable populations are coping,\u201d says Martha Robinson of Ottawa Public Health. She also chairs the city\u2019s extreme weather committee.The project will identify the hot spots, which will then be overlaid with information about potentially vulnerable people within the city. Kids, the elderly and homeless people are most at risk during a heat wave and Ottawa Public Health hopes the project will help.\u201cThe second part of the project is going to look at some specific parks to see how they can be made cooler, looking at what types of vegetation might work well in a park with lots of seniors, that kind of thing,\u201d says Robinson.Dundonald Park on Somerset Avenue is one area Ottawa Public Health hopes to improve.Robinson noted rooftop gardens, lighter-coloured building materials and constructing parking lots underground as long-term methods to reduce the heat-island effect,\u00a0 as well as simpler things such as water fountains, shaded benches and splash pads as immediate ways for residents to cool off in public parks.Bonnie Mabee, chair of the Centretown Citizens Community Association\u2019s trees and green-space committee, says the issues need to be looked at more broadly.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, to be quite honest, that (OPH) have a lot of leeway as to what they can do about it,\u201d she says. Hot spots could probably already be identified, Mabee noted, but solutions are what matters.\u201cCan you make sure that somebody can go through some of those apartments to help some of these elderly people if there\u2019s a heat wave? Are we making sure we\u2019re pushing the city to do more greening of buildings and reducing energy?\u201dMabee identified building design as the number one solution, noting Vancouver is way ahead of Ottawa in having \u201cgreener\u201d buildings that incorporate water- and energy-efficient technologies and sustainable building materials to reduce environmental impact.Association vice-president Rob Dekker says there\u2019s a delicate balance between developers, the city and the community to finding an equilibrium between laying down more concrete or dealing with the heat island effect.\u201cWith rising property values in Centretown, a decent-sized plot for a park is going to cost $1 million or more for the city to purchase, and that\u2019s before greenscaping and putting in things like benches. It\u2019s going to come down to whatever formula the city can come up with,\u201d Dekker says.\u201cI think there has to be a political will. . .\u00a0 to do that and we\u2019d like to see from (Coun. Diane Holmes) and through the planning and environment committees some political will demonstrated to have more greenspace added downtown.\u201d\u00a0",

New barriers will replace the current ones on the north side of the highway from Bronson Avenue to Lyon Street and on the south side from the O-Train to Preston Street and then from Lyon Street to the Rideau Canal, according to the design. The details of the new walls have not been confirmed, but Ottawa Centre MPP Yasir Naqvi says the Ministry of Transportation typically uses concrete absorptive barriers standing four-to-five feet tall. Dekker says he doesn\u2019t know why certain areas are chosen over others but he has an idea.\u201cThey are going to get a bigger bang for their buck by putting them on the south side and affecting people in the Glebe and not people in Centretown,\u201d he says.Naqvi, on the other hand, says potential locations for sound barriers are identified and the ministry then looks at options to install them with other highway projects in the area to maximize cost savings and efficiency. He says that the decisions are all part of the Queensway redevelopment project that is currently underway. That project has focused on the expansion of the east and west sides of downtown.Now that construction is driving its way into the core, the attention is on improving existing noise barriers, ramps and paving, says Naqvi. Centretown residents have complained about the noise pollution for years according to both Naqvi and Dekker. \u201cIt\u2019s loud,\u201d says Centretown resident Tanya Pascoe, \u201cyou always hear cars, ambulances and heavy trucks whizzing by.\u201dPascoe lives in an apartment on the corner of Arlington Avenue and Percy Street parallel to the Queensway where the only new barrier on the north side is set to go up. Naqvi is encouraging residents such as Pascoe to provide their feedback on the proposal. He says \u201cpeople by large are very happy to see the process moving on.\u201d It has been eight years since the area was added to a waiting list for new barriers, according to an article published in Centretown News in 2009.In 2008, the preliminary design received environmental clearance, says Naqvi. \u201cAll that\u2019s left now is for the plans to be finalized for one more public consultation and then the actual construction,\u201d he says. But according to David Lindensmith, Ministry of Transportation senior project engineer, construction will have to wait until funding is secured and the expansion of the Queensway from Nicholas Street east to Highway 174 is finished. That project is set to begin this spring. Dekker says the CCCA will use the waiting time to continue to lobby for new barriers. \u201cThe positive is that we will have an opportunity to try and make some changes to the plan and maybe have more of Centretown affected by the positive aspects of the noise barriers,\u201d he says.",

    "body": "Archeologists with trowels will be joining construction workers and their backhoes this spring in LeBreton Flats as the next stage of development at the sprawling downtown property prompts a renewed hunt for Ottawa\u2019s early history.\r\rCondominium builder Claridge Homes has completed two residential projects and has embarked on the third phase of a long-term housing plan for the Flats, but Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird \u2013 the federal government\u2019s senior minister for the Ottawa area \u2013 recently expressed disappointment with the design of the initial buildings and urged faster progress on developing the area west of Parliament Hill.As the process of replacing the contaminated soil in the area continues, a few select zones will be receiving special attention from the National Capital Commission, which owns and manages the riverside stretch of land. Those areas have been identified as having high archeological potential and will be monitored by heritage experts during the soil removal process.\u00a0LeBreton Flats has long been recognized as a key site in Ottawa history and thus an important target for archeology. Assessments of the archeological potential of the flats were conducted as early as 1991. More than 25 sites have been excavated and documented since 2001.Those sites are from the 19th and early 20th centuries and have included a school and a hotel as well as low- and high-income homes. The findings have provided insight into the life and habits of people from all classes who lived in the area during Ottawa\u2019s 19th century transformation from a pioneer lumber village to the nation's capital.\u201cOur knowledge of the past is usually based on written history,\u201d says Jean-Luc Pilon, curator of Ontario archeology at the Canadian Museum of Civilization. \u201cBut there are vast parts of human behaviour that never get recorded.\u201dHe cited as an example the discovery of drug vials and glass syringes in the latrine of a 19th century hotel during one of the earlier digs at the flats, which shed light on drug use during that period.During the past decade\u2019s excavations, more than 250,000 artifacts were collected and are now being stored by the City of Ottawa. Ian Badgley, an archeologist with the NCC, the federal agency that owns the land, says it wants to do more targeted work to complement the artifacts and information already gathered. \u201cIndiscriminate collecting has no value whatsoever. Without an orientation, you can\u2019t determine the value or the significance of the resources you are recording,\u201d he says.\u201cWe want to represent the Flats as an evolving community, not simply as an industrial site.\u201dIn order to do so, Badgley says the NCC is in discussions with the city about using the artifacts and data collected to do an exhibition telling the story of LeBreton Flats.Even before that happens, though, the reports of the different excavated sites at LeBreton Flats are in the public domain, and can be requested by anyone through the NCC. To Badgley, the public should know more about the area what\u2019s been done by archeologists.Work at the site \u201cis educational,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t remember the past developments, then our identity is weakened.\u201dConnecting with people from the past is also what\u2019s important to Jeff Earl, an Ontario archeologist who has worked at the Flats since the first excavations more than a decade ago.Every unearthed object \u201cjust puts you in touch with people in the past, instead of just reading names on a book, or census,\u201d he says.He noted that while digging up the foundation of one 19th century house at LeBreton Flats, his crew came across a glass liquor bottle that had been built into a stone wall.\u201cIt was probably hidden there by the mason when he saw his supervisor coming,\u201d he said, speculating about the story behind the stone-encased bottle.Badgley says that\u2019s what\u2019s powerful about archeological work.\u201cIt\u2019s not the artifact that is important. It\u2019s the person behind the artifact. In this regard, (archeology) honours people from the past.\u201d",

Graham Saul, executive director of Ecology Ottawa, a company that focuses on local environmental issues, said many homeowners are reluctant to retrofit their homes because they don\u2019t know how long they will stay at the house to reap the financial benefits of their investments.\u201cBy creating the possibility that you can repay a loan through your property taxes, you create the opportunity for someone to make an investment,\u201d Saul says. \u00a0\u201cThe key thing is that the loan stays with the home, not the person.\u201dThis means if a homeowner invests in green retrofitting and then moves to a different home, the new owner assumes the loan repayments and continues to benefit from the fittings. The main goal for the roundtable was to begin the steps to updating its Air Quality and Climate Change Management Plan, as the current one expired in 2012.The 2004 plan aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent at the corporate level, and 20 per cent at the community level by 2012. But according to a memo released by the city\u2019s Environmental Services Department last year, greenhouse gas emissions had only dropped by 12.5 per cent at the corporate level and emissions increased by 0.9 per cent at the community level.Corporate level emissions refer to the city\u2019s own operations, including its buildings, while community level emissions refer to greenhouse gasses produced by local businesses and individuals that live and work in Ottawa.Saul said the city gave a clear commitment to update the existing climate change plan within the year, look at the city\u2019s own greenhouse gas emissions, and come up with new targets.\u201cThe mayor clearly stated that he not only intended to meet the targets, he intended to exceed them,\u201d Saul says. More green businesses in the Centretown area could be a way to exceed these targets. VRTUCAR, a car sharing company that caters to the Centretown area, aims to lessen the amount of cars on Ottawa roads to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. Clients can reserve an environmentally friendly car for a few hours at a time, only paying for the time they use the car. Owner Wilson Wood says Ottawa has a road congestion problem and the car-sharing model helps alleviate that because up to 24 people end up sharing the same car. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same ordinary car but the way its being used is both environmentally friendly and economically a much more efficient use of the vehicle.\u201dFounded in 2000, VRTUCAR started with one car and four members. Today, the company has over 100 fuel-efficient cars and about 2,600 members in the Ottawa and Gatineau area. Centretown engineering business Hasall Associates specializes in retrofitting existing and new buildings to be energy efficient and sustainable.Halsall's Business development manager Shawn Carr, keeps the company constantly striving for corporate sustainability.\u201cOur team for example is working hard to reduce our carbon footprint by reducing emissions from our buildings, our travel and commuting habits,\u201d Carr said in an email.In fact, Halsall\u2019s Ottawa office on Gladstone Avenue received a platinum rating in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, for its environmentally friendly retrofitting in 2008. \u201cWe strive to bring our commitment to sustainability to our clients through the projects we deliver,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe are currently one of the most active green building consultants in the city.\u201dSaul says Ottawa is a great city to bring in the PAPER project, with one of the best-educated populations in the country.He says in order to move toward a greener Ottawa, the city just needs to remove the barriers stopping Ottawans from investing in green projects, such as the uncertainty of how long someone will be in their home. \u201cThe first challenge for the city will be making sure that as it proceeds with the official plan review, it\u2019s taking its greenhouse gas reduction objectives into consideration and we\u2019re looking forward to engaging with the city on that issue.\u201d ",

    "body": "Erin Morawetz, Centretown NewsAt only 23 years of age, skip Rachel Homan (second from left) will get more chances on the world stage. It\u2019s been a wild ride for Team Homan since winning the Scotties Tournament of Hearts back in February.\r\rCompeting at the world women\u2019s curling championships in Riga, Latvia, Ottawa\u2019s favourite women\u2019s curling team has brought a bronze medal home to Canada.After winning the Scotties\u2019, Rachel Homan and her teammates Lisa Weagle, Alison Kreviazuk and Emma Miskew, were invited to attend an Ottawa Senators game at Scotiabank Place, where they were introduced on the big screen. They also appeared on CTV Ottawa Morning, met Mayor Jim Watson and had tea with Prime Minister Stephen Harper. While the celebration lasted weeks, the girls had to turn it around quickly to be ready to head overseas for the world championships.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a challenge,\u201d says coach Earle Morris. \u201cEspecially when you come back to Ottawa and there are a million different requests from the media to talk to the girls. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re still celebrating the Scotties and the next thing you know it\u2019s time to go away.\u201dMorris says the travel and unfamiliar conditions might have shocked the girls at first. They were especially thrown off by a flight delay in Germany that skewed their schedules and postponed their arrival in Latvia.\u201cIt\u2019s a little tough to start because it\u2019s an international stage and the girls had to sleep in an airport in Frankfurt \u2013 just not ideal conditions to start off with,\u201d Morris says. \u201cThe ice conditions weren\u2019t as good as we were used to in Canada where everything is perfect.\u201dThough their 4-2 record in the first six games might suggest otherwise, Morris says Team Homan \u201cstumbled out of the gate\u201d at the worlds. They followed a tournament-opening loss to Scotland with wins over Latvia, Denmark, and Russia, before losing to the Americans and beating the Italians.Still, after going 12-1 at the Scotties, a 4-2 record meant the team was not playing their best.\u201cIt would be fair to say that we struggled a bit with our shot-making and team dynamics because everybody\u2019s a little stressed or maybe a little tense getting started,\u201d says Morris. \u201cSo we stumbled out of the gate and for maybe the first six games we were pretty ordinary.\u201dThe turning point, though, came after that sixth game. With a 4-2 record, Rachel Homan\u2019s Ottawa Curling Club rink was set to face eventual silver medalist Sweden. Though they lost the game 8-4, Morris says this game set the tone for the rest of the tournament.\u201cOur team dynamics were really good and I said, man, that really reminds me of the Scotties \u2013 that\u2019s how they played at the Scotties and that\u2019s how they got along at the Scotties,\u201d says Morris. \u201cSo even though we lost I had a big smile on my face because I said, this is really good, I like the way it\u2019s gone.\u201dThe team would finish the round robin with an 8-3 record before earning a rematch with Scotland in the semi-final.The semi-final game came down to the last shot, but Homan jammed her stone on a double takeout attempt to\u00a0 give Scotland\u2019s Eve Muirhead the winning point and a berth in the final.Scotland would go on to beat Sweden in the gold medal game. Team Homan would face the Americans for the bronze, beating them 8-6 to ensure Canada finished on the podium for a second straight year.While Homan wasn\u2019t able to bring Canada a gold, which would\u2019ve been the first since 2008, curling fans have seen the team give a face to a growing sport.\u201cTeams are now starting at 8 and 10 years old and becoming insanely good teams,\u201d says Dylan Haggart, a Carleton student who curls out at City View Curling Club. \u201cJunior curling is up even more because of their celebrity.\u201dHoman got her start at City View. Her winning banners still adorn the walls of the club, and the team\u2019s success can give hope for aspiring curlers across the city.",

    "body": "Nine national titles in 11 years for the Carleton University men\u2019s basketball team is one of the most impressive records in university sport.\r\rIn the past five years, Carleton has compiled a 166-6 record against fellow teams from Canadian universities.They have also recorded four undefeated seasons while under the careful tutelage of head coach Dave Smart.In the most recent championship win \u2013 a 92-42 annihilation of Lakehead University \u2013 they set records for winning margin and for lowest opponents points.Yet, it\u2019s not good enough anymore to be the best in your country. Now, you have to be the best in the continent.With the United States in the grip of March Madness and sports writers evaluating the merits of every team in the competition, the attention has started to drift north of the border.For the past several years under the tenure of Dave Smart, rumours and whispers have abounded about making the switch to competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).With Carleton brushing aside all their opponents, some think that a switch would add more competition.A switch would mean the end of the winning tradition at Carleton, something fans can\u2019t imagine.If the Ravens were to join a different league and started losing, attendance would suffer. As seen with the Carleton football team, as well as the Ottawa CFL teams, a losing record breeds apathy and contempt. For the sake of the winning tradition and understanding how different the competition is, Carleton shouldn\u2019t make the switch.Currently, only one Canadian team has made the switch to join the league down south: Simon Fraser University, in Burnaby, B.C. They joined Division II of the NCAA nearly three years ago and have seen varying degrees of success.Their football team has failed to register a winning season and failed to make the playoffs since joining the NCAA.The women\u2019s basketball team was five-time Canadian champions before the switch. It hasn\u2019t won a championship since.Smart has faced these questions before. Carleton now takes part in a \u201cCross-Border Battle\u201d for pre-season, facing off against NCAA Div. I teams. They\u2019ve competed in those games but never dominated, compiling just under a .500 per cent winning record.They\u2019ve lost to New Mexico State, University of Louisville and the University of Cincinnati.\u201cThey\u2019d be like a Seton Hall, or a lower level, rebuilding team,\u201d said Rick Pitino, the head coach of the Louisville Cardinals, after a pre-season game in 2006.But making the switch to a different league is more than adapting to new teams.The size difference between Ravens players and players in the NCAA is huge. Players are bigger, faster and stronger which would cause problems if Carleton started competing.After the latest championship victory, Smart admitted that while he thought his team could compete, injuries would hamper their cause due to the physicality of the game.The travel schedule would also be a hindrance to Carleton.Bus trips to Toronto and other Canadian teams would be gone, replaced by flights or even longer rides to American cities.Student athletes, who already face a tough time scheduling courses around their varsity commitments, would have a tougher time planning their coursework around the travel.In some circles, a switch would be seen as a chance to revitalize the CIS competition. Speaking to fans and coaches before the finals, the overwhelming discussion of any potential winner was unanimous: Carleton.For teams, how disheartening must it be to not really be recognized when the talk of national championships come up?The crowds seemed to agree too, as the final played out to large sections of empty seats. But that\u2019s a larger indictment of how Canadian basketball needs to earn more recognition.There have been a handful of sold out games at Carleton during my time here. If Carleton wants to retain its popularity, a switch to the NCAA shouldn\u2019t happen.",

    "body": "Matthew Lee, Centretown NewsThe grizzly bear statue will be replaced by  the Stanley Cup monument if a local committee has its way.  Ottawans can finally be sure of the future location of a monument to Lord Stanley \u2013 and the trophy that famously bears his name.\r\rBut the announcement has raised unexpected controversy as well.\u00a0 Last week, hockey fans and history buffs alike learned that the corner of Sparks and Elgin streets \u2013 already home to a piece of civic art \u2013 will eventually boast a statue commemorating the former Governor General whose contribution to hockey was immortalized with the donation of the Stanley Cup in 1892. \u201cOur objective is to do something that really ought to have been done a long time ago,\u201d said Paul Kitchen, president of the not-for-profit group behind the project, at the press conference to reveal the location. However, the announcement has met with some backlash, especially from Tamaya Garner, the widow of sculptor Bruce Garner. His bronze grizzly bear statue, Territorial Prerogative, now stands at the end of the Sparks Street Mall and will have to be moved to accommodate the new monument. She says she wasn\u2019t informed that her husband\u2019s work would be displaced and has publicly criticized the decision.\u201cBefore offering up the Grizzly\u2019s spot, the Sparks Street Mall Authority could have called and written to me,\u201d she said, in an emailed statement. \u201cWe could have worked together.\u201d Garner has said that she\u2019s still willing to negotiate a move with the city, but won\u2019t commit either way, adding that Sparks Street would benefit from more public art, not less.\u201cI realize now that this is not just about moving one of Bruce\u2019s sculptures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about how artists are perceived and treated.\u201dAlthough the city did propose a handful of other locations for the Stanley Cup monument, including a plot at Major\u2019s Hill Park and the plaza adjacent to city hall and the Rink of Dreams, its advocates ultimately chose the Sparks Street spot for its historical connection to the cup.\u201cWe wanted the location to have a relationship to the event that is portrayed,\u201d Kitchen said. \u201cSo the fit was perfect.\u201d The Russell Hotel, where the idea for the trophy was first conceived, once stood directly across the street from the location.The announcement came 121 years to the day since Lord Stanley\u2019s offer to donate the cup for the region\u2019s hockey teams, just metres away from the entrance to the Sparks Street Mall. However, Kitchen made it clear that the cup\u2019s historical connection to the city shouldn\u2019t lessen the monument\u2019s meaning to visitors.\u201cWe like to think of it as a national monument in a local setting, rather than a local monument in a national setting,\u201d he said.Mayor Jim Watson, on hand for the announcement, said that although the competition to select a design for the monument has yet to be announced and money for the statue still needs to be raised, things are moving forward.\u201cWe pride ourselves on being known as a hockey country,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better location than to have (the statue) right here.\u201dPlans for the memorial were first set in motion four years ago, when Kitchen, a hockey historian, came up with the idea. The concept quickly gained support, when members of the city\u2019s hockey community formed a committee to move the project forward. The monument will be officially unveiled in 2017, a year that the council deemed significant in part for its ties to the anniversary of confederation.Several board members joined Kitchen at the announcement, including Murray Costello, former vice-president of the International Ice Hockey Federation, who addressed the cup\u2019s international reach and its appeal to young players across the globe. \u201cSomebody said to me this past week that this should\u2019ve been done 50 years ago,\u201d Costello said. \u201cWe may be 50 years late, but we\u2019re going to try and do it right.\u201dHe also hints that the design competition itself may stir some controversy. Although the organizers have described the contest as Canada-wide, Kitchen says that they may extend it to artists from across the globe as well.\u201cThe Stanley Cup is an international trophy,\u201d he said. \u201cPlayers from many countries play for it, so why not open up the competition?\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if a Russian artist or a Finnish artist came forward with a design? That would be a compliment to us. It shows that this country, and the game, are important to people elsewhere.\u201d",

The cancellation has those involved with the high school girls\u2019 league worried that it might not return at all. The labour action caused many high school sports teams in Ottawa to turn to parents for support for the extra-curricular activities. But high school girls\u2019 water polo doesn\u2019t enjoy the same wide base of parent support as other sports, says David McClintock, coach of the Nepean High School team.\u201cI was putting out phone calls to parents, but we couldn\u2019t get enough numbers to run the league by the deadline,\u201d says McClintock. \u201cAnytime you lose a season, it\u2019s not a good sign for that league coming back.\u201dThough the cost of equipment is low (just a swimsuit), water polo isn\u2019t easy. The game resembles basketball, with floating nets instead of hoops. Players must be good swimmers, as they are not allowed to touch the bottom of the pool during the game. Not to mention the sport is full contact, and the referees on the pool deck rarely catch any punches, kicks or bites under the water.Immaculata and Glebe, two schools that draw students from Centretown, would have been legitimate contenders to be playing for the title this April. Immaculata held a 7-3 win-loss record in the 2012 season, while Glebe went undefeated en route to the championship. Together, the schools had 10 players invited to the all-star game. Lisgar Collegiate didn\u2019t field a team last season.Despite its small, six-team size, the league provides a valuable route to university varsity teams for many of the girls, according to Alison Hunter, last season\u2019s chief referee. Hunter also served as an assistant coach to the Carleton University\u2019s women\u2019s water polo team. It\u2019s not unusual to see girls who played in the Ottawa high school league become starters for varsity programs, says Hunter.\u201cFor basketball players, if you didn\u2019t get talked to by university coaches, you wouldn\u2019t even show up to the try-out. Water polo isn\u2019t like that; the teams will accept walk-ons,\u201d says Hunter. \u201cA player who might not see the water in their first year could develop into a starter by graduation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure our girls are disappointed,\u201d says Harry Zarins, coach of the Immaculata team. \u201cWe had a few talented first years last season, and had a pretty favourable season.\u201dThough his freshmen will miss out on a valuable year of development, Zarins is optimistic the league will return. He acknowledges that it will require the work of all the coaches to get the necessary support.But for now, the future of the six-team girls\u2019 league remains questionable. The boys\u2019 league folded in 1998, and has yet to return. The only way to prevent the girls program from the same fate is to find someone to take charge of the league, says Hunter.\u201cMainstream sport or not, every cause needs a champion,\u201d says Hunter.",

Plans for redevelopment of McNabb Park, near the corner of Bronson and Gladstone avenues, have officially begun with a proposal by Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes to add a mini-soccer field, a skateboard park and a community garden.\r\rPlans to redevelop the park will try to fulfill and combine the diverse nature of the Centretown community, says Holmes. Other suggestions include a renovated dog park area and new play equipment. Currently, the park remains an open green space with a couple of trees and a few playground sets.\u201cThere have been many interests from various groups to see more active recreation in the downtown,\u201d including avid gardeners and skateboarders, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely piece of land in a great location.\u201dWhen the city approved its budget in February, the Community Garden Network was a key player, pushing to establish a garden at McNabb Park this year.Hired staff and Holmes herself are responsible for the new design. However, Holmes says plans are likely to change because they\u2019re still at a preliminary stage and she welcomes input from the\u00a0 community. An open house on March 27 at the McNabb Community Centre, led by Holmes, heard ideas on the planning of the redevelopment. \u00a0Holmes says she hopes to have a budget of approximately $800,000. Holmes says the timeline of the proposed plans is uncertain but in a flyer sent out on March 18 Holmes said that the redevelopment is set to begin this summer.While news of the city\u2019s plans to redevelop McNabb Park is gradually making its way to the members of the community, the Centretown Citizens Community Association says it remains optimistic for its future changes. \u00a0\u201cThese are great additions to what McNabb Park already has, and encourages people to get out and do additional exercise,\u201d says Robert Dekker, CCCA vice-president.The current space is often used as a picnic and play area and has been booked as a venue for fundraisers. New designs indicate that there are no plans to get rid of the already existing hockey rink or wading pool. This recent proposal is one step of many for councillors to accommodate the growth of the community, says Dekker. With current condominium developments in process, population in Centretown has been increasing.\u201cGreen space is at a premium and there\u2019s not a lot of space available,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to look at the current ones we have and do some rejuvenating of those, whether through construction or whatever plans that has to be done to meet the needs of the community as it continues to grow.\u201d Jack Purcell Park, near Elgin Street, also received a recent facelift, with improved fencing and sitting areas, and its base-ball diamond was converted to a soccer field.McNabb Park was established in the 1970s beside McNabb Community Centre, and is the largest green space in Ottawa\u2019s downtown area.\u201cWe\u2019re leaving a good big piece of open green space for people to just come and picnic and enjoy the park without it being organized,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cI\u2019m hoping there will be more groups and more people using the park as a result (of the new design).\u201d",

The city predicted it would bring in approximately $3,078,000 for 2012, but received only $773,309, leaving a gap of $2.3 million. However, Chenier said that the shortfall was partially offset by \u201csavings in activation and recognition expenditures of $645,043\u201d making the total gap approximately $1.7 million.This was expected to be achieved through various sponsorship opportunities, including naming rights, inferior advertising signage, website and publication advertising. According Chenier, the successful sponsorships to date include: -\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0pouring rights agreements with Coca Cola for \u201cexclusive pouring rights in all City facilities\u201d; -\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0naming rights agreements for two arena ice pads at Walker Baker Recreation Complex; -\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0billboard advertising; -\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Family Physiotherapy Program Sponsorship, and various other naming rights agreements. Mayor Jim Watson expressed disappointment with the program early this week, saying that the city was \u201coverly optimistic\u201d in projecting potential revenue from this project, according to a report from the Ottawa Citizen. The city hired a consultant for this project for a five-year contract. The consultant, the Centre for Public Sector Marketing, receives a commission of 15 to 20 percent on naming rights, program and event sponsorships and advertisement sales. They also receive compensation for consultation services. To date, the CPSM has received $7,600 in commissions and $16,000 in consultation fees. Chenier told the Citizen that city staff have undertaken some of these sponsorship projects themselves, and added that they are looking into revenue generated from a partnership with Internet providers that would result in free Wi-Fi services in various municipal facilities. The Wi-Fi would cost no money to taxpayers and would be provided free of charge in several municipal facilities. ",

Work will also be done in the Dow\u2019s Lake tunnel and the Carleton University pedestrian underpass.

    "body": "Erin Morawetz, Centretown NewsLori Mellor, of the Preston Street BIA, is fighting against over-developments in Little Italy. Key players in the community say they are gearing up for a battle over two controversial issues in the proposed Preston-Carling development after the city deferred the plan for further study late last month.\r\r\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a busy spring and summer. It\u2019s not the victory we wanted, but it is at least not a loss and so we\u2019ll happily keep things going,\u201d says Michael Powell, president of the Dalhousie Community Association. \u201cWe think there are lots of good arguments on our side and not so many on theirs.\u201d The two contentious issues on deck are an intensified \u201cmews\u201d \u2212 a new north-south road lined with nine-storey buildings along the east side of the Carling-area O-Train tracks \u2212 and two new vehicular bridges over the O-Train to access the mews. The city\u2019s planning committee decided last month to accept the municipal staff\u2019s recommendation to defer these two issues for further study. However, the committee accepted other parts of the plan, such as new design rules for high-rise buildings in Little Italy to ensure they have distinct tops to improve the skyline. Committee chairman Peter Hume told planning staff at the meeting that it\u2019s critical they have strong justification for any decisions about the mews and bridges.Powell says he\u2019s optimistic the city will keep community leaders involved in the process.\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep at it and keep reminding councillors and planning staff that there\u2019s lots of room for development in Little Italy, and lots of room for intensification,\u201d Powell says. \u201cBut when you\u2019re designing a community, you have to remember what makes a community important, and for us it\u2019s that low-scale residential feel.\u201d Powell isn\u2019t the only community stakeholder to promise to keep fighting what many residents believe is an over-development of the area. \u201cThey deferred them (the mews and bridges), but that still doesn\u2019t protect the neighbourhood, \u201d says Lori Mellor, executive director of the Preston Street BIA. \u201cI have worked at the BIA for 10 years. We have a vision about what this neighbourhood should look like in the end,\u201d Mellor says. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to destroy the residential fabric of the neighbourhood.\u201d The proposed mews and bridges are part of the Preston-Carling strategic direction report. It sets out the development for Preston Street between Carling Avenue and the Queensway. The report acts as a placeholder until an official community design plan is achieved. George Dark, an urban-planning consultant, developed the plan. He has described the area surrounding the Carling O-Train station as Ottawa\u2019s next development hot spot. It will eventually have some of the tallest buildings in Ottawa, including Claridge\u2019s proposed 42-storey condo tower at 505 Preston St. But while some prepare for battle, there are others who welcome the proposed changes.\u201cI\u2019m for it. It will just bring more life to the neighbourhood,\u201d says Richard Urquhart, the owner of the Black Cat Bistro, which has been open on Preston Street for five years. Urquhart says he hopes development will revitalize the area and lead to grocery stores and other retailers moving in. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to change. I like the idea,\u201d Urquhart says. \u201cI just like the life of it, the bustle. I don\u2019t quite understand why you would oppose them. Have you seen some of the buildings around here? They\u2019re pretty run down.\u201d It is expected that a full community design plan for the area will be worked out by next fall.",

The board hears planning and development issues appeals, with board members appointed by the provincial government.Naqvi held his third Sustainable Community Summit with the public about the OMB last year and published a report this March with comments and suggestions from those who attended.\u201cI think we need to take a more holistic approach and that is to look at different reform mechanisms,\u201d Naqvi says, adding thatthe legitimacy of the board has come into question over the years, Naqvi says, and at this stage there needs to be reform.The OMB has faced calls for its abolition from various stakeholders, including accusations of bias in favour of developers.During the 2011 election campaign, Naqvi proposed four changes, including mandatory mediation between applicants and appellants and incorporating community design plans as enforceable policies in a city\u2019s official plan. Currently, official plans and secondary plans are given more weight as legal documents, while community design plans are guiding policies that don\u2019t get the same consideration.Rob Dekker, vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association and co-chair of its planning and development issues committee, says the OMB is not working.\u201cMediation would help, but I think what would go a lot further would be developers reaching out to the community and meeting with the community beforehand,\u201d Dekker says.\u201cWhile mediation is an important part of what is being proposed with the OMB, I think what is actually important is for the city, the planning department, and developers to recognize is that these developments should be discussed with the community before they go to the city.\u201d Ted Fobert, a senior partner with planning and urban design firm FoTenn, says the OMB generally works well and that finding the balance between flexibility and certainty is really what the discussion is about.Fobert says municipal issues such as zoning bylaws would reduce some of the disputes that go before the board, so when applications come forward for buildings permitted in the official plan, it\u2019s not a huge shock and there\u2019s no spot zoning happening.\u201cThe other area where there\u2019s been friction is where there are guidelines for growth,\u201d Fobert says. \u201cWhere the community might like to see them more entrenched in an official plan and the development community would like a little more flexibility, so they\u2019re not having to amend an official plan every time they have to reduce a setback by one metre or something.\u201d",

    "body": "The Ontario government is taking a stand for Ontario farmers with the introduction of the Local Food Act at Queen\u2019s Park last week. If it is passed, the act aims to increase local food awareness, access and sales by setting local food goals and targets, as well as increasing the promotion of local products.\r\rHowever, this act doesn\u2019t take into account the already vast network and infrastructure surrounding local food. Most people are already aware, and interested, in the local food industry. Promotion and advertising are not necessary to encourage sales of local products.In Ottawa alone, there are many local farmers markets, especially during the summer months. Just outside of Centretown, residents can visit the Brewer Park market or the year-round Parkdale market, as well as the Main Farmers\u2019 Market at St. Paul University. The popularity of these markets shows that people are very willing to buy local, as long as the products are accessible. Ontario farmers and businesses produce over 200 different commodities available to purchase at markets and grocery stores. For those who can\u2019t make it out to the farmers markets on the weekend, many grocery stores have locally produced foods clearly marked or labelled.Food like beef, eggs, vegetables and dairy products are produced and sold in the province, sitting on grocery store shelves with a \"Made in Canada\" or \"Foodland Ontario\" label stuck to them. Besides grocery stores, many restaurants are also taking part in the local food scene.For example, seven Centretown restaurants are members of Savour Ottawa, an initiative to develop Ottawa as a culinary destination for local foods and experiences. This means that these restaurants must purchase at minimum 15 per cent of their food costs, or $25,000, directly from local farmers. Although many people love to buy fresh, local produce, the higher prices of local food can be staggering and may be holding back potential buyers from switching to local food.If the Ontario government wants to support the local food industry, then they should help even out the cost difference between local products and cheaper imported foods by lessening business costs and investing in local businesses.The government recently provided the Ontario Cattle Feeders\u2019 Association with a one-time investment of $10 million to create a risk management fund, a move which will help stabilize pricing for producers and encourage growth in the sector. As well, $1.5 million worth of grants were given out last September to food suppliers to help offset the higher costs of buying local. More grants like these should be available to help grocery stores and distributors decide to choose local food over imported products. The government\u2019s encouragement to buy local in the Local Food Act is commendable, but Ontario products need to be more financially competitive before people will go out of their way to make the switch to buying locally. Until then, for those willing to go the extra mile and pay an extra buck for their groceries, the local market is ready and waiting.",

These rising tariffs are a hidden tax on everything, from clothing and shoes to household cleaning products to televisions.They are also increasing your Employment Insurance taxes. Increasing this tax on jobs is reckless when so many areas of the economy are still struggling.Jim Flaherty is increasing taxes on hospital parking, taxes on life insurance, taxes on safety deposit boxes, taxes for airport security, taxes on credit unions, and the list goes on.For years now, Conservatives have tried to boast that they never raise taxes. That was easy to do when they took power and inherited a $13- billion surplus from the previous Liberal government. However, these tax-and-spend Conservatives dug themselves into a deep deficit. They increased program spending by almost 40 percent and are now hiking taxes left, right and centre.It\u2019s time for the Conservatives to show Canadians some respect and be honest about taxes.

    "body": "Boys will be boys. When Layla Cameron titled her March 25 blog post, she wasn\u2019t referencing a flippant clich\u00e9. She was commentating on the less-than-tactful media coverage of the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case.\r\rCameron studied media and gender studies at Carleton University and then started work for Media Action and its Represent project. The Represent project offers a forum to challenge damaging media representations of women. The Steubenville case concerns the night of Aug. 11, 2012 when two high school football players sexually violated an incapacitated female peer, and documented their acts through social media. Ma\u2019lik Richmon and Trent Mays, both 16 years old at the time, have been convicted in juvenile court for the rape of a minor.The international community watched as the case came to a close, and with it media sympathy for the convicted rapists.CNN called the boys \u201cpromising students\u201d and NBC news lamented on their \u201cpromising football careers.\u201dThe ABC program 20/20 began an online piece by writing the case was \u201cevery parent\u2019s nightmare.\u201d The tragedy, based on the media coverage, was not that two boys had committed a crime, but at their age they would enter the criminal justice system. Not only do these commentaries victimize the convicted, they perpetuate rape culture.Rape culture means we live in a society where rape and sexual assault are normalized through cultural patterns, a lack of education about consent and a court system that blames victims by prioritizing rapists\u2019 stories.Cameron says a way media perpetuates rape culture is by giving irrelevant details when commenting on sexual assault cases.\u201cDon\u2019t talk about what girls were wearing, don\u2019t talk about how much they\u2019ve had to drink, don\u2019t talk about anything that makes it seem like they asked for it,\u201d adds Cameron.\u201cNo one asks to be violated.\u201d\u00a0Unfortunately, the Steubenville case isn\u2019t the lone incident of media coverage gone wrong.It occurs often enough to spur the creation of groups such as Take Back The News, founded in 2001. The aim of the group is to confront the misrepresentation and underrepresentation of sexual assault in mainstream media by \u201cimproving both the quantity and quality of media coverage of sexual assault.\u201d The organization provided outlets for rape survivors to publish their stories in their own words before it disbanded in 2009. But the issues the group tackled did not disappear. Groups such as Media Action in Canada have taken a stand against inaccurate media depictions of sexual assault.But media still provide inaccurate coverage. As an industry with overwhelming reach and influence, the effects can be daunting.Overall, the rate of sexual assaults being reported to the police declined in 2011, down three per cent from the previous year, according to a report by Statistics Canada.Aggravated sexual assault, which police categorize as the most severe, saw a decline of 23 per cent. But this doesn\u2019t reflect a society that is increasing in safety or decreasing in the occurrence of sexual assaults. Statistics Canada noted the number of sexual assaults reported by police is an undercount. \u201cThere are many reasons that victims gave for not reporting sexual assaults to police including the belief that the incident wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d the report says. Meaning, the assault wasn\u2019t at a level of violence for the victim to feel justified in reporting it.With media coverage lamenting a girl\u2019s drunken state as the catalyst for sexual assault, thereby ruining the lives of teen football stars, these downward trends aren\u2019t surprising. Those who report to the police face the possibility of being publicly chastised by bad media coverage at a later date.Sarah McCue, a member and support worker for the Coalition for a Carleton Sexual Assault Centre says rape culture is something people face daily, partially through recycled media stories. \u201cThe media representations of sexual assault cases are not the only driving force for rape culture,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it definitely doesn\u2019t need any helping hands.\u201dSo how does it stop? It\u2019s critical to provide solutions, or the cycle never ends, but it\u2019s also important to examine media coverage, Cameron says.But she never received any formal training in covering sexual assault because it isn\u2019t something that people like to talk about.Talking about sexual assault, though, is crucial. Cases such as the one in Steubenville cannot incite rage among media consumers only to fade into the background until the next high profile sexual assault. Maybe it's the lack of training that is responsible for this imbalanced media coverage of sexual assault, but it needs to end. McCue says the media, at the very least should treat sexual assault as any other crime in which the victim is not blamed or questioned.But that\u2019s a low bar to set. There needs to be dialogue about sexual assault outside of media because changing the way they cover sexual assault isn\u2019t the only requirement to ending rape culture. ",

    "body": "Cheers and waving flags filled a crowded Parliament Hill late last month when the 270 Nishiyuu Walkers reached their destination.\r\rThe Nishiyuu Walkers were a group of seven young Cree men named David Kawapit, 18, Geordie Rupert, 21, Raymond Kawapit, 20, Stanley George Jr., 17, Travis George, 17, Jordon Masty, 19, and Johnny Abraham, 19.They started the 1,600-kilometre, 68-day march from Whapmagoostui, Que., a small village on the shores of the Hudson Bay, on Jan. 16 to back the Idle No More movement. Over the course of their walk, other First Nations communities joined in support.One aim of the movement is to persuade the federal government to collaborate more with First Nations leaders on issues such as enivronment protection, selling of aboriginals land and self-governance on reserves.But earning the prime minister\u2019s attention is proving difficult for the long-travelled group. Though NDP leader Tom Mulcair and Green Party head Elizabeth May greeted and congratulated the walkers in Ottawa, Stephen Harper skipped town. The glamour of a photo opportunity proved too tempting for Harper, who greeted fresh-off-the-plane Chinese pandas in Toronto. Apparently, the bears urgently needed to meet the nation\u2019s leader before they started a five-year stint at the Toronto Zoo.The prime minister\u2019s snub of the walkers was made something painfully clear: the federal government doesn\u2019t intend to mend a broken relationship with the country\u2019s First Nations communities.\u201cIt continues to speak to the fact that the government has no interest in resetting the relationship,\u201d says Jean Crowder, NDP aboriginal affairs critic and MP for the Nanaimo-Cowichan riding in B.C., which boasts a large aboriginal population.\u201cThe government has to come at it with good faith. It has to change its mindset and be willing to sit down as equal partners at the table to talk about solutions.\u201dBut ignoring the Nishiyuu Walkers\u2019 arrival in Ottawa delays finding solutions to problems the trek addressed, such as poverty and insufficient space on reserves. In fact, many Inuit and Algonquin people, for example, joined the march to Ottawa from areas without access to roads.How do their efforts and determination not earn Harper\u2019s support? Even a mere handshake would be a sign of good faith and possibly open the door to future collaboration. In addition, only a week after the walk, Crowder says MPs in the House of Commons discussed the contentious Bill S2, which tackles questions of property ownership after aboriginal couples divorce, for the first time in two years.Many First Nations regard the bill as an infringement of their sovereignty. And it is. Because provincial divorce laws don\u2019t hold power on reserves, the federal government sees a need to further challenge aboriginal self-governance by implementing its own legislation.Undoubtedly, these laws would challenge aboriginal traditions.The Harper government\u2019s discussion of Bill S2 mere days after the walkers arrived at Parliament Hill does only one thing: widen the ideological gap between Ottawa and First Nations communities.But at this rate, without so much as a handshake for the Nishiyuu Walkers, relations with aboriginal communities will remain fractured as long as the Conservative party are in power.",

The company is using a crowd-funding website to raise $25,000 to pay for the construction of its theatre space in Hintonburg. Great Canadian Theatre Company has launched a crowd-funding campaign to raise $25,000 for the remaining costs of its theatre space.\r\rThe theatre company\u2019s \u201cBe a Story Builder\u201d campaign began on March 20 and runs for 60 days. The company moved into a new space located on Wellington Street West in 2007. The theatre cost $11.7 million to complete and the company had only raised $10.3 million. Mukhabbat Aliyeva, the theatre\u2019s development assistant and co-ordinator for the campaign, says this effort will cover just a portion of the $500,000 shortfall that remains. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be too ambitious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we still wanted to give it a try.\u201dShe says the remainder of the shortfall will be made up in continuing fundraising efforts outside of this campaign. Aliyeva says the company needs more money to produce shows and hire people and the shortfall limits the company\u2019s creative side.Crowd-funding campaigns collect money from donors using the Internet and social media. In a fixed funding campaign, the organizer must reach its goal in order to collect the donations once the campaign is over. However, the theatre company\u2019s campaign is flexible funding, which means it collects the money whether or not the goal is reached.\u201cCrowd-funding is really gaining a lot of attention and popularity,\u201d says Aliyeva.She says the company decided to use a crowd-funding campaign to raise money because it is easily accessible and convenient for donors. It also offers constant updates and gives exposure to the cause.Aliyeva says the theatre company is important because of its economic and cultural impact in Ottawa. \u201cOur mandate is to produce Canadian plays and tell Canadian stories,\u201d she says, adding that\u00a0 the company\u2019s plays attract people from all over the country.Inspiring passion in people is crucial to attract donors, says Matt Cooke, founder of CrowdFund Buzz, an American organization that offers services internationally for people wanting their crowd-funding campaigns more visible through press and social media. \u201cThe project managers need to express why the cause is important and why people need to get behind the project,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of projects in the \u2018cause\u2019 category explain why the project is important to them but fail to explain why it should also matter to potential backers. If the project cannot get their message across to other people, they are going to struggle to hit their goal.\u201dCrowd-funding mentor Lee Andrews has a formula that he says leads to successful campaigns.\u201cThe first five per cent of funds need to come from people very close to you \u2013 friends\u00a0and family. Then you need to reach out to your networks \u2013 social media, newsletters,\u00a0friend\u2019s\u00a0social media, anyone connected to you in some way,\u201d he says. \u201cThis will hopefully push you to 25 to 30 per cent, once you hit 25 per cent, strangers will start donating to your campaign. This is when you reach out to newspapers, local media outlets, and national media outlets. Getting picked up will push you the rest of the way to your goal.\u201dAndrews is vice-president of business development for crowd-funding website When You Wish. He also provides advice on Twitter for any crowd-funding campaigners who get in touch with him. He says using the formula and working hard on promotion leads to successful campaigns. Aliyeva says the campaign will not be considered a failure, even if it doesn\u2019t reach its goal.\u201cWith this campaign, we realize how many people support us,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a success in itself.\u201d",

    "body": "Festivals are a lot like real estate: location matters.\r\rSound bleed issues aside, LeBreton Flats works well for the thousands of people that flock to Bluesfest each year. The Ottawa Jazz Festival has long roots in Confederation Park. Westfest puts on engaging musical performances while showing off what Westboro has to offer.It\u2019s something that the organizers of Ottawa Sucks, a new hardcore punk festival, obviously get. The festival\u2019s small performance spaces, such as\u00a0 the Royal Canadian Legion on Kent Street, are great for sweaty, powerful and energetic shows. Don\u2019t let that combative name fool you. Ottawa Sucks is here to praise the city as much as it is to bury it. The festival, organized by Germ Attak member Jo Steel, features 25 bands from across the globe. Many of the acts hail from the capital, but those from outside the region will also get their chance to shine.Like the best punk music, the name is also rather subversive. It attacks Ottawa\u2019s reputation as a boring, bureaucratic city while showing off the capital\u2019s exciting musical underbelly. Many Ottawa music fans could learn from this tactic, instead of just lobbing the same old complaints and doing nothing about them.In some ways, Ottawa Sucks is following in the wake of another festival, the Ottawa Explosion Weekend. Both are weekend-long events. Sucks kicks off April 12-14, while Explosion runs from June 20-23. Both take place at multiple venues around Ottawa. And, most importantly, both act as a showcase for vibrant, local music scenes that continue to thrive under the radar.In fact, the Ottawa Explosion blog gave Ottawa Sucks some publicity back in January, posting the new festival\u2019s line-up. Emmanuel Sayer, a festival organizer for Ottawa Explosion, is also playing Ottawa Sucks on April 12 with his band Pregnancy Scares. Sayer says the new festival offers punk fans a venue that the city\u2019s arts scene doesn\u2019t provide anywhere else. \u201c(Steel) was just talking about doing a big hardcore punk festival, which is definitely something that Ottawa doesn\u2019t have, so that\u2019s great,\u201d Sayer says. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a good accompaniment to Ottawa Explosion because it kind of touches some genres that we don\u2019t necessarily touch during our festival, although we\u2019re kind of branching out as well.\u201dEvent organizers still have a lot to grapple with, though. Ottawa doesn\u2019t have enough venues, Sayer says, and while putting on a show at a legion is very punk rock, non-performance spaces have to work harder and organizers often have to supply their own equipment.But it\u2019s that hardship that makes music from Ottawa so resonant. Sayer even says that the lack of music infrastructure around the city helps foster solidarity among bands.\u201cPeople who are involved in the scene will meet people who are playing in different types of bands and who are going to different types of shows,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019 kind of atmosphere where everyone\u2019s trying to play wherever they can play and swapping information when someone finds a venue that can book a band.\u201dUltimately, Ottawa music fans need to take a page from both Steel and Sayer. By now, \u201cOttawa Sucks\u201d has become the standard refrain for anyone with little attachment to the city\u2019s underground music scene. It\u2019s a horribly self-defeating attitude, and it won\u2019t help venues or artists grow to the point where they can break out of that \u201cbest kept secret\u201d label.Bottom line: If you don\u2019t see art that appeals to you in this city, fill that void and make it yourself. Ottawa Sucks looks poised to do just that. The festival has already turned a snide, shallow phrase aimed at the local music scene into a rallying cry for it.",

Ottawa is known for its museums, landmarks and political history, but local poet and author Christian McPherson defines his hometown by its cinemas, old and new.\r\rMcPherson came of age while sitting in dark movie houses and those memories comprise his third book of poems, My Life in Pictures, set for release April 15. He says that several weekly trips to cinemas in Centretown and the Glebe inspired the creative prowess within him.\u201cI think part of becoming a writer was about my love of movies and wanting to write a screenplay,\u201d McPherson says. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a crack at (screenwriting) but I\u2019ve never finished it. So I decided, well, I\u2019ll just get my feet wet with some short stories, some poetry. It has grown into this second career.\u201dEach poem in Pictures takes the name of a film, but many of the titles relate to the bitter and comic chapters in his life. McPherson writes about watching Jaws at a drive-in as a petrified child of five, as well as his youthful obsessions with Superman and the original Star Trek movies. McPherson says he also fondly remembers watching classic films from the 1930s and 1940s.\u201cMy mom was a nurse and she would wake me up, feed me a hot breakfast and then go off to work at 7 a.m., leaving me home by myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI would usually tape a film off of CBC Late Night or TVO. I\u2019d watch an old Humphrey Bogart or James Cagney film. If I didn\u2019t finish them in the morning, I would come home and finish them at lunch.\u201dUnsurprisingly, it was a film that also got McPherson focused on pursuing writing as more than just a hobby. As the book\u2019s \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d poem testifies, watching rookie screenwriters Ben Affleck and Matt Damon pick up Oscars in 1998 propelled McPherson to pick up a pen. Pictures also tells the story of the relationship between McPherson and his father, Jim, who was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder late in life. McPherson writes that it was hard to look after his father. Jim often took his son to shows at the Somerset Theatre, which closed in 2000, the year after Jim died. McPherson\u2019s father never saw him pick up his first major honour: winning a short story contest and $500 from the Ottawa Public Library in 1999.His early short story collections later caught the eye of Chris Needham, the publisher of Now or Never Publishing. Needham says that McPherson is a refreshingly honest voice in Canadian literature.\u201cA lot of (what McPherson writes) is incredibly personal stuff,\u201d Needham says. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but respond to it. It\u2019s so blatantly honest, talking about himself so openly. It could be seen as almost narcissistic, but I don\u2019t see any ego from him.\u201dAlong with the Mayfair Theatre and ByTowne Cinema, many landmark cinemas that are relics of Ottawa\u2019s past pop up throughout the book. McPherson says some of his fondest moviegoing experiences happened at the Phoenix, an art house theatre on Bank Street, and the Capitol Square Cinemas on Queen Street. The Mayfair will host a poetry reading by McPherson on April 20 featuring material from his new book \u2013 some of the poems even name-check the 81-year-old theatre and heritage site.McPherson will also be reading his newest poems at the main branch of the Ottawa Public Library on May 17 and at Raw Sugar Caf\u00e9 on May 30. Guests at the Mayfair will get an extra treat. McPherson will screen a short film that he made as a high schooler at Glebe Collegiate.\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018Nightmare on Prep Street.\u2019 It\u2019s about a little preppy kid who gets chased through the halls by punks and eventually is cornered and turns into one,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to show that just for a lark so you can see me running around in grainy, unfocused footage.\u201dMcPherson wrote the poems for My Life in Pictures in four months and says he writes as often as he can \u2013 sometimes during 15-minute breaks from work or after he tucks his kids into bed. He is currently working on a thriller and two more collections of poetry, while a sequel to his debut novel, the comedy The Cube People, is set for release this fall.Even with a wife, two kids, three books in the works and a demanding public service job as an IT computer programmer, McPherson says he still gets out to the movies once or twice a week. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of the Silvercity kind of \u2018Bing! Bang! Pop! Noise!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI prefer the small theatres.\u201d",

A proposed Canadian ban on importing shark fins for a traditional Chinese soup was narrowly defeated last month in Parliament, but the controversy surrounding the Asian delicacy has prompted two Centretown restaurants to remove it from their menus anyway.\r\rA bill proposing to end imports of shark fins \u2013 introduced in 2011 by British Columbia NDP MP Fin Donnelly \u2013 was defeated in the House of Commons late last month by a margin of five votes.For now, the soup that had been occasionally sold in Chinatown\u00a0 can still be legally prepared.When the bill was introduced two years ago, diners in Centretown would have been able to order shark fin soup in classic Chinatown restaurants such as the Yangtze or Chu Shing. But the two businesses, among the oldest Chinese restaurants in the city, no longer serve the soup.\u201cWe (took the soup off the menu) because of the contentious nature of the issue,\u201d says Yangtze manager Kim Ng. \u201cThere are still a few people who ask for it, but it\u2019s not an everyday dish.\u201dDonnelly was \u201cdisappointed more Conservative MPs did not support this important legislation,\u201d he said in a press release.The Conservatives officially opposed the bill, but promised to introduce their own legislation on the issue in the near future.Donnelly\u00a0 has a history of fighting for environmental causes.His shark fin bill didn\u2019t pass, but the awareness created around the issue \u2013 which has also been debated in several municipalities and provincial legislatures across Canada \u2013 appears to have had ripple effects in Ottawa.The controversial issue is how shark fins are obtained for the soup. Fishermen that practise finning catch sharks, cut off their fins and then discard the rest. Since the other parts of a shark are not worth nearly as much as its fins, it maximizes fishermen\u2019s profits. A single fin from some rare species can be worth tens of thousands of dollars, according to Greenpeace Canada.The shark is doomed to die once its fins are removed. Not being able to move properly without its fins, the shark drowns. But shark finning is different from shark fishing. In Canada, for example, fishing sharks is legal, but targeting only the shark\u2019s fins is outlawed.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re pushing for is to make sure fishermen bring the whole shark ashore,\u201d says Charles Latimer, Greenpeace\u2019s oceans campaigner in Canada. \u201cThat way, we physically limit the amount of sharks caught.\" Greenpeace estimates the fins of 26 to 73 million sharks are sold worldwide each year, which means up to 8,000 sharks are being killed every hour.Although Canada forbids finning in its waters, no country can properly control what fishermen do in international seas. That\u2019s why Greenpeace supported Donnelly\u2019s bill, Latimer says.\u201cThe reason we support bills like (Fin Donnelly\u2019s) is because banning the imports of shark fins to Canada would reduce the international demand for shark fins,\u201d he says. \u201cBut those are only mitigating measures, while we push for more protection for sharks.\u201dCultural barriers have proven difficult to overcome, however. In Toronto, a bylaw that had forbidden the sale of shark fin soup was implemented last year but was overturned in November after local Chinese residents appealed saying the bylaw targeted the Chinese community in Toronto.Ng, however, says traditions involving shark fin soup are changing.\u201cIt used to be that the parents would have a say on the menus of weddings, and then shark fin soup would be present,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now the people getting married usually choose . . . not to have shark fin soup.\u201d",

If that\u0092s the case, you\u0092d better listen \u0096 or she\u0092ll knock you out.Shourav Barua (left) and Jeremy Flores spar at the Beaver Boxing Club ahead of the upcoming Big Fight Night on April 19. Jill Perry says it\u2019s better than seeing a movie. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019d better listen \u2013 or she\u2019ll knock you out.\r\rBeaver Boxing Club will hold the Big Fight Night In Little Italy April 19 to raise money for its Youth Boxing Program, an initiative to keep teens off the streets and get them into the ring. The card will feature 20 boxers of all ages and skill levels.The club has been hosting fight nights since it opened in the 1940s. It slowed down in the early 2000s before moving to its new location on Spruce Street, when\u00a0 Perry realized the club needed to connect with its neighbours.\u201cIt\u2019s an awesome opportunity for the boxers to get to fight in their hometown, in front of their friends,\u201d says Perry. \u201cAnd again it just helps us to be part of this community . . .\u00a0 it\u2019s just a great night out.\u201dAccording to Perry, a typical audience for a fight night at the club will range between 250 to 300 people. Which begs the question, is boxing that popular in Ottawa?Eric Belanger, head coach at Final Round Boxing in Chinatown, says the sport is making a gradual comeback in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201cI think it\u2019s in a shift right now,\u201d says Belanger. \u201cIt\u2019s been in a lull due to mostly lack of professional athletes coming out of this area; I mean there\u2019s literally been none since the \u201870s and \u201880s. And now we\u2019ve been developing a decent amount of pros.\u201cThe interest is slowly growing. Before, there was no local talent. Now we\u2019ve got local talent like Andy Gardiner, Pascal Villeneuve, Tyson Fury.\u201dIn years past, safety concerns may have discouraged people from entering the ring.Perry is quick to refute the notion that boxing is a dangerous sport that kids shouldn\u2019t try. While she says professional boxing\u2019s reputation as an easy way to get head injuries may be accurate, she is quick to defend amateur boxing, calling it one of the safest sports there is.\u201cThey have very different outcomes,\u201d Perry says. \u201cAmateur boxing . . .\u00a0 we have a medical before every bout; we have a doctor that comes to the event and medicals every athlete that\u2019s going to compete that night \u2013 and if they don\u2019t pass the medical, they don\u2019t box.\u201dPerry is a two-time Canadian amateur boxing champion despite having only started boxing at 28, an age at which most in the sport are headed toward retirement. But she says the sport changed her life then, and it certainly is taking a major role in changing it now.\u201cI can only say for me as a competitor; the transferrable skills I gained physically and mentally as a person helped me to succeed in life,\u201d says Perry. \u201cI have a very successful career and I think a big part of that came from my boxing; my belief in myself, and just the ability to commit to something.\u201dOne of Perry\u2019s commitments was organizing the club\u2019s fight nights. This year, however, she had to take a step back from that role to deal with something far more important. Of course, she is using lessons she learned from boxing to do so.\u201cIt taught me how to focus and commit and work hard towards things and achieve things,\u201d Perry continues. \u201cI do that in my career, I do that in my personal life \u2013 for myself right now, I was recently diagnosed with cancer \u2013 I\u2019m using the skills that I gained as a boxer to battle my cancer. And I am very confident that I will beat this, and I can say that only because that\u2019s what boxing has taught me.\u201dWhile Perry talks eagerly and enthusiastically about boxing, others speak of her the same way. Seema Singh, who organized Fight Night, stresses how much of a positive presence Perry is at the club despite her role having been limited due to her illness.\u201cShe is such an amazing person with a very powerful voice, just very high spirits all the time, everybody loves her,\u201d says Singh.\u201cShe\u2019s one of those people that, she\u2019s very friendly; she is the backbone of this gym,\" Singh continues.\"All the kids here, she loves everyone individually, she really takes everyone under her wing and takes this gym to heart; she takes it very seriously. She really wants everyone to be at their best.\u201d Still, Perry cannot stop talking about her favourite sport. And when she does you get the sense that, for Perry, it\u2019s about more than just the sport.\u201cI can honestly tell you there is nothing more thrilling than boxing,\u201d says Perry.\u201cNothing is more exhilarating than getting in the ring and looking across at this other person who has the headgear on and a cup and big gloves, and know that when the bell rings you are going to hit each other,\" Perry adds. \"It\u2019s exhilarating; it\u2019s scary and exhilarating.\u201dShe repeats those words: scary and exhilarating, and for good reason.That is what her life is like right now.For Perry, the Fight Night comes at a good time; though she couldn\u2019t commit the time to organize the event, she knows she needs boxing now more than ever.",

Lakers 33-game win streak.LeBron James put the team on his back throughout the impressive streak, pouring in 760 points \u2013 on average 28 points per game - as he helped shoulder the physical and mental load.But with the streak now in tatters, the Heat have dominated headlines and sports talk shows with the rightly earned talk of \u201cgreatness\u201d.James is the youngest player in NBA history to reach the 20,000-point milestone. During February, in the middle of the winning streak, he became the first player in league history to score 30 points and make 60 per cent of his shots in six straight games.He has now rightly earned the moniker of \u201cKing James\u201d that has been with him since his days in Cleveland.In an age dominated by television cameras and bloggers willing to criticize any real or apparent flaw in a player\u2019s performance, one trend has emerged.We are in a golden age of sports.In soccer we have Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo dominating, hockey has given us Sidney Crosby and basketball has now offered up LeBron James.Every sports fan can sit you down and bend your ear for hours talking about their favourite players, underrated players and hated players.But fans have never had such a variety of talented choices, across a broad range of sports.Since returning after a concussion, Sidney Crosby has easily re-established himself as the best player on the planet, netting 15 goals and collecting 41 assists. Compared to a normal season, he would be on pace for 135 points.Wayne Gretzky achieved the seemingly unbeatable record of scoring at least two points per game in the 1985-1986 season, with a total of 215 points. No NHL player since has ever come close.Before fans get up in arms about me comparing \u201cSid the Kid\u201d to \u201cThe Great One,\u201d take a moment and look at those numbers. It shows how far the sport has come that we\u2019re now graced with another similar athlete.Soccer has given us two athletes to put on a pedestal. While fans can debate the merits of both, what they should realize is that they\u2019re the best seen in years.The traditional argument amongt soccer fans is to compare Diego Maradona and Pele. Messi and Ronaldo are different.The sport has evolved since Pele and Maradona graced the pitch. It\u2019s now more fitness-based than ever.Messi and Ronaldo have been able to transcend this and become prominent in the elusive North American market.For Messi, the title is definitely deserving. He scored 91 goals in one year, the most ever in one calendar year, surpassing the previous record of 85 set back in 1972.He\u2019s also comprehensively beaten the single season goal scoring record, hitting 73 compared to the 63 scored by Gerd Muller in the 1970s.While Messi hogs the attention, Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player to score against all 19 teams in the Spanish league in a single season.Soccer has two idols who have divided fans over who is the best, but that\u2019s not the real argument here.What fans should recognize and appreciate about is the overwhelming amount of talent gracing arenas and rinks around the world.\u00a0Welcome to the golden age \u2013 long may it last.",

The girls work with coaches and mentors in three-hour sessions which, after 10 weeks, culminate in a 5K running event.Girls on the Run offers coaching to girls aged eight to 13 and aims to build both their running ability and their confidence, and since 2004 it\u2019s grown from 21 girls at one school in Toronto to more than 70 schools and 1,000 runners province-wide. Dina DeDonato, CEO of Girls on the Run Ontario, says the program aims to help girls before they are put into challenging situations. \u201cThe key to our program is prevention,\u201d she says. \u201cYou empower the girls with tools that enable them to deal with bullying situations or at-risk situations.\u201dNazareen Elkout, who will be an assistant coach at the Flavor Factory\u2019s workshops, agrees that working with children from a young age is essential. She heard about the program through word-of-mouth, and was immediately intrigued by the idea, in part because of her own family\u2019s encounters with bullying in schools.\u201cMy kids, over the years, they\u2019ve gone through growing pains,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I\u2019ve always wanted to volunteer working with teens.\u201dHer youngest son was targeted by bullies in high school, and by that age she says it was difficult to help him rebuild a sense of self-esteem. Building that confidence early on is important and part of the reason she thinks Girls on the Run can be so effective.\u201cIt affected not just him, but the entire family,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it seemed like it was almost too late, because he was already at that age. If we can help these kids\u00a0 today, from an early age, then they can stand up for themselves.\u201dDeDonato also stresses the importance of the program\u2019s group setting, which gives girls who may otherwise see themselves as outsiders a chance \u201cto feel part of something bigger than them.\u201d That\u2019s another element of the program that attracted Elkout, who says the power of that group dynamic is something she sees all the time in Flavor Factory\u2019s dance classes.\u201cThere\u2019s this hubbub among the kids, of teamwork and camaraderie and helping each other,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do with this \u2013 bringing people together, and giving kids something to be passionate about.\u201dAfter this year, DeDonato says that she\u2019s looking to introduce Girls on the Run to different regions of Ontario, and other provinces, and if the warm reception that it\u2019s received so far is any indication, there are plenty of communities willing to participate.\u201cIt\u2019s really been an organic expansion,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been through wonderful Ottawa citizens who have championed it and brought it to the area. It\u2019s been a slow process, but we want to make sure that we continue to have a quality program.\u201dAt the end of the day, however, she says the girls\u2019 focus is still on the finish line, if perhaps not in a competitive sense.\u201cWe want them to be able to have the confidence to pursue their own goals and to increase their physical activity,\u201d she says. \u201cFor a child that might go out for competitive sports, or a child that wouldn\u2019t dream of doing such a thing \u2013 they all cross the finish line as athletes.\u201d ",

Centretown residents and businesses are preparing for changes in the way the city manages so-called \u201curban lanes\u201d \u2013 back alleys and other small streets with ambiguous ownership and maintenance issues.\r\rCity staff presented a report to the transportation committee in early April with recommendations regarding the way encroachment on these lanes is managed. The report and its recommendations were accepted by the committee and passed on to council for discussion on April 24.The report says there are 64 kilometres of such lanes in Ottawa that are not subject to a comprehensive council policy. City officials want to improve the way they are managed as an asset, with respect to maintenance and encroachment.If homeowners or businesses are encroaching on city streets, they could be subject to minor fines, according to the report.Several issues led to the creation of the report, dating back to January 2010. City staff needed to address problematic situations such as the sale of lane portions, which left landlocked parcels of property inside certain blocks with no access, or created dead ends, according to the report.Staff also confronted maintenance issues and perceptions by some property owners of inconsistent responses to applications to create parking spaces.Changes to city policies could have an impact on local businesses. Many lanes are used for access to parking and deliveries. One of those lanes connects James and Gilmour streets, running behind businesses operating along Bank Street.The Buzz Restaurant and Lounge uses the lane to access employee parking and receive supplies, says Jeanette Bouchard, general manager of the restaurant.\u201cIt\u2019s important mainly because of the deliveries,\u201d Bouchard says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have people coming through the front door.\u201dChanges to the way the laneway is managed could affect the parking and delivery-truck access for all businesses along the alley, says Bouchard.There is also some confusion about who should be maintaining the laneway, according to Joseph Nasr, general manager of Bridgehead Coffeehouse at Bank and Gilmour streets.A private contractor plows the laneway during the winter, says Nasr. \u201cI don\u2019t know from whom he gets paid. I guess maybe the landlord.\u201dThe recommendations in the report would establish a policy requiring the city to clearly state who is responsible for the maintenance of these laneways.Some concern was voiced at the committee meeting by Linda Hoad, a member of the Hintonburg Community Association\u2019s board of directors. The report was premature, Hoad says.\u201cI\u2019m really shocked and surprised that there has been no consultation. We\u2019ve been talking with (city staff) for several years about \u2018When is the report going to come out about lanes?\u2019\u201d Hoad told committee members.City officials did not have to provide notice to the public about the report because it dealt with city-owned streets, according to Alain Miguelez, the city\u2019s program manager for zoning, intensification and neighbourhoods.The process for dealing with city roadways, sidewalks, and laneways is different than approving development applications on private land, Miguelez said.The report should have been deferred for further discussion with the public, according to Hoad.Innes Coun. Rainer Bloess agreed. \u201cI\u2019m a little surprised at the sudden urgency of this to go to council,\u201d he said.\u201cEncroachment issues in back alleys and lanes have been around ever since the Champlain Sea covered this land.\u201d\u201cSome citizens are assuming these laneways belong to them,\u201d Rideau-Rockcliffe Coun. Peter Clark said at the committee meeting, opposing deferral. \u201cWe need to have an encroachment policy that will reserve the city\u2019s interests.\u201d",

Centretown resident Rob Bender, who is blind, has encountered problems in the past trying to book transportation through Para Transpo, which is operated by OC Transpo. He is generally happy with the service because these on-going bookings can be made further in advance, but casual bookings such as medical appointments are more complicated.\u201cPeople who require vans, if they\u2019re in a wheelchair for example, can call at 7 a.m., but I can\u2019t call until 9 in the morning the day before I need transportation,\u201d Bender says. \u201cBy the time I get through the phone queue, the bus is often already full.\u201dCustomers must book single trips over the phone, which can only be done the day before. The phones open at 9 a.m. and this is what causes the long phone queues. The system was set up to avoid cancellations at the door but can cause problems for clients. \u201cI know they\u2019re doing what they can, but being on hold for, like, 30 to 40 minutes while I\u2019m at work is not really optimal,\u201d he says. Karen Scott, who has multiple sclerosis, relies on Para Transpo to take her to doctor\u2019s appointments as well as physical therapy sessions. \u201cI always call right on the dot of 9 a.m., but I usually don\u2019t get through until 9:40 and by that time the busses might already be full,\u201d she says.Scott says when she has tried to book transportation through Para Transpo, more than half of the time she has needed to find another option because they simply couldn\u2019t find a seat for her. Troy Charter, who is in charge of transit operations at OC Transpo, says the organization is aware of problem.\u201cThe past five years we\u2019ve experienced an increasing interest to our service, but the demand is getting so high now that we\u2019re having to look for new ways to provide the service to as many people as possible,\u201d he says.Charter says Para Transpo is working on coming up with a solution to better suit the costumers\u2019 needs, including a recommendation to\u00a0 allow customers to book three to seven days in advance.\u00a0 ",

    "body": "As buses, bicycles and cars jostle for space during rush hour in Centretown, the National Capital Commission has developed a plan that could ease the commute for some residents by better integrating the transit systems of Ottawa and Gatineau.\r\rIn a report, the NCC proposes a \u201cdowntown circulator\u201d connecting the central cores of the two cities, creating more compatibility between OC Transpo and STO bus routes running across the Ottawa River. Also recommended in the report are extensions of the O-Train to make a stop or two in Gatineau, as well as some reserved transit lanes in the downtown core and across the Champlain Bridge. Currently, there are limited transportation options in the national capital region due to urban rights-of-way which favour private automobiles,\u201d says the report. Each city is working towards constructing rapid transit systems \u2013the Rapibus in Gatineau and Confederation Line in Ottawa, the first portion of the light rail train system.These projects were included in the study and having these systems work well interprovincially is one of the goals. Improving efficiency, reducing congestion and protecting the environment are the stated goals of the transit report.\u201cThe rapid transit systems in both cities are in the state of significant change,\u201d says Vivi Chi, the City of Ottawa\u2019s manager of transportation planning. \u201cIntegrating the two different technologies requires continuous co-operation between the two cities.\u201dPeter Raaymakers, executive director of advocacy group Transit Ottawa, writes a blog about public transit in the city. He\u2019s skeptical about whether the study offers any viable solutions.\u201cBringing OC Transpo and STO together into one regional transit utility, in theory, sounds like a no-brainer; implementing that idea would be hugely problematic, though,\u201d he says. \u201cFinding some way to equalize the finances from taxpayers under different municipal as well as provincial tax systems would be a huge administrative burden . . .\u00a0 It\u2019s not impossible, but I\u2019m cynical about how realistic it is despite the fact that it\u2019s a sensible recommendation.\u201dThe final goals of the study include an eventual merging of the two companies under one name, set of routes and trip-planning system. Raaymakers points out, it\u2019s the administration and funding of such a project between several government bodies that makes this a challenge.Geoff McDillon, a Gatineau resident who works in Ottawa\u2019s westend, says that due to deficiencies in the transit system he prefers to take his truck or bike.\u201cGatineau has the worst transit system I\u2019ve ever seen and Ottawa isn\u2019t too far behind,\u201d he says. \u201cI would never trade the one hour it takes me to commute to work in my own truck for the almost three hours it would take me on a bus. In the summer, I commute to work by bike and it only takes 40 to 45 minutes each way.\u201dNew transit infrastructure should attract high-value, high-density and mixed-use development, according to the NCC\u2019s report, in addition to shortening the trip for someone like McDillon. Attracting a new transit user and getting his truck off the roads, in theory, should make the city\u2019s downtown more livable.According to the report, the O-Train extension, Gatineau\u2019s Rapibus, light-rail train services, the downtown circulator and reserved transit lanes \u201cshould be implemented\u201d by 2021.

    "body": "Matthew Lee, Centretown NewsA construction project on Gladstone Avenue may eliminate some on-street parking. Design plans for construction that is set to begin this summer along Gladstone Avenue between Bank and Cartier streets have brought up concerns as parking spaces will be traded for trees. The construction will upgrade a century-old water main and sewer system, says project manager Susan Johns.\r\r\u201cTheir time is way past due to be repaired,\u201d says Scott Gorry, membership secretary of the Centretown Citizens Community Association.At the project\u2019s open house on March 26, city plans showed that curbs and sidewalks will be widened to allow for new \u201cbeautification\u201d amenities such as benches, bike racks and more trees. \u201cOverall, the street will be more pedestrian-friendly,\u201d Johns says.Planting more trees, however, will eliminate some on-street parking spaces, Johns says, adding that Gladstone Avenue, between Bank and Cartier streets, currently has51 parking spots and the construction design will reduce that to 35 once trees are added. \u201cAdding one tree usually means removing one parking space.\u201dThe biggest loss of parking will be between Metcalfe and Elgin streets where design plans show its 25 spots will be reduced to 16.There are currently two lanes along Gladstone, one for parking and one for driving. Johns says widening the sidewalk will take up the curbside parking lane.Johns says the public\u2019s input is very important and people have expressed concerns about the parking issue.\u00a0\u201cThis is their street and we show it to them to ask what they think,\u201d he says.The city\u2019s planning committee and consultants review the publics\u2019 comments, says Johns, adding that any trends in those concerns, \u201cmeans we probably made a mistake, or a bad choice.\u201d Gorry says the comments may be well-received by the city, but when it comes to implementation, very few suggestions actually get translated into the design plans. In terms of repairing the city\u2019s infrastructure, Gorry says the CCCA supports the project, but has concerns that future considerations are \u201cnarrow-minded.\u201dGorry says the city has not acknowledged some of the CCCA\u2019s recommendations, including where benches should be placed along the four blocks. Construction is set to begin in July and will take more than one construction season to complete. Gorry says the age of the infrastructure is something that could cause challenges and delays during construction. Considering the summer start date, the impact on St. Luke\u2019s Park, between Elgin and Cartier streets, is another issue.It\u2019s possible the Gladstone entrance to the park will be closed for part of construction, Johns says.

    "body": "Private businesses and consultants are urging the city to keep the world-renowned Leadership in Energy and Environment Design certification as part of its green-building policy.\r\rLEED is a not-for-profit green building ratings system used in more than 100 countries to promote ecologically and fiscally responsible buildings. Since 2005, the city has required buildings over 5,400 square feet to receive the certification.But the system was almost abandoned in January by the city\u2019s environment committee when Somerset Ward Coun. Diane Holmes successfully moved to get rid of the standard because of the backlog in the certification process. She cited 14 recently constructed city buildings still waiting for certification, three since 2009.She suggested instead of having third-party certification by the Canadian Green Building Council, the city could create its own system. However, the committee decided to commission a report to look at the system already in place. The report will be presented to the environment committee before summer break. Capital Ward Coun. David Chernushenko says he hopes the committee will not only reconfirm the program, but also raise the city\u2019s LEED standard from silver to gold. The levels of certifications are certified silver, gold and platinum and are reached by earning a certain number of points related to materials selection, air quality, energy efficiency and more. Fifty per cent of Canadian building projects are certified by this system and the numbers are increasing every year, says Mark Hutchinson, the director of green building programs for the Canadian Green Building Council. He says even if the city did get rid of the current system businesses would continue to seek the certification. While building green may cost around five per cent more in initial construction expenses, over the lifetime of a certified building the benefits may far exceed the initial investment. Businesses are moving toward LEED standards because environmental sustainability goes hand-in-hand with future economic growth, says James McNeil, vice-president of Cushman & Wakefield Ottawa, a real estate group. Cushman & Wakefield has been studying the growth in Ottawa\u2019s green space, or the number of buildings that have received environmental certification. The study found that at the beginning of 2009 there were 3.7 million square feet of green space, but that number almost tripled to 11 million by the beginning of 2012. Christopher Simmonds, a Centretown-based architect, says he is seeing similar trends with his clients. He helped design the Rideau Valley Conservation Centre, the first LEED gold standard certified building in eastern Ontario. Its energy and water consumption are 42 and 80 per cent less, respectively, than standard levels. Chernushenko says he thinks LEED is the way forward. However, with the certification backlog, the future certification might be limited to only certain buildings, while others will follow the already laid out procedures. \u201cThe city should be taking a leadership approach,\u201d Simmonds says.

    "body": "The 2013 budgets for Ottawa\u2019s business improvement areas have been approved, but not all business owners in the city are happy with the spending being proposed in their areas.\r\rOne area in which there is concern is Somerset Village, the short stretch of Somerset Street between Bank and O\u2019Connor streets. The budgets, which are laid out by the directors of the city\u2019s individual BIAs, vary greatly in terms of the amounts being set aside for development and maintenance. For example, the city\u2019s more well-known BIAs such as Bank, Preston and Sparks streets are set to see spending of about, $750,000,\u00a0 $465,000 and $500,000 respectively in the coming year, while only $10,300 has been allotted to Somerset Village for maintenance. Mayor Jim Watson says the disparity is due to geography. He says that since Somerset Village occupies a much smaller area than larger BIAs, it naturally receives less money for development because fewer businesses operate there. This means less money is available from annual levies drawn from establishments inside Somerset Village than in places with many businesses like Preston Street.

All it attracts is bums,\u201d Stacey says. Another eyesore he points to is the abandoned 19th-century heritage building, Somerset House, on the southeast corner of Somerset and Bank streets. He says the run-down building has sat empty for more than half a decade serving as a blemish on the area's image.Linda Anderson, the chief of bylaw and regulatory services for the city, says efforts have been made to improve the look of the building that has been unused and unfinished since a wall collapsed during a construction project\u00a0 in 2007. \u201cUnpermitted postering on the hoarding around Somerset House has been removed,\u201d she says. \u201cThe owner has committed to painting the hoarding once the weather improves.\u201d Stacey added that he would like the city to step up and help in the effort to rejuvenate the Village \u2013 a task that a number of the business owners on the street have already started to take on in cooperation with one another.\u201cIn the summertime\u2026 if you look down the street, it\u2019s like an old street in Montreal, you\u2019ve got that caf\u00e9 look that makes an attraction,\u201d Stacey says \u201cBut that\u2019s us who are doing that, the city\u2019s not even involved.\u201dWhile the businesses in Somerset Village are taking it upon themselves to revive the street\u2019s image for now, Mayor Watson syas he thinks more attention will get paid to Centretown\u2019s \u201cforgotten\u201d BIA in the near future if city council\u2019s plan to increase the downtown population goes as planned. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to allow people to live in the downtown,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that we don\u2019t just come downtown to work, but we come downtown to live and to play.\u201d",

Although it may not be as common to consume the stories in comic book form anymore, each of these multi-million dollar grossing movies and TV shows were graphic novels first. What was once a niche industry has exploded to find mainstream success \u2013 and with that comes mainstream money.The industry has progressed a long way from the early days of Marvel and DC and five-cent comics. Ottawa, as it should, has embraced it.Despite all of its drab, suit-wearing, government culture, the city has become a thriving home for the often against-the-grain, push-the-limits world of comic books. One group of Ottawa residents in particular have seen the potential the industry has to grow and the money that can be made.Entrepreneurs Jason Daley, Douglas Duncan and Donald Lanouette launched their company UcreateComics in December to build on the global strength of the comic book industry. They started UcreateComics as a way to find and promote talented comic book creators all over the world. The three local men recently closed a $1-million fund to help finance the work of artists and writers from around the world who submit worthy ideas to the company\u2019s website. Although they are getting ready to embark on a world tour to raise awareness and recruit international artists and writers, the company\u2019s home base in Ottawa has them perfectly situated.Boasting seven comic book stores, Ottawa knows its stuff. But it doesn\u2019t stop there.Ottawa is also home to North America\u2019s biggest animation festival, another medium UcreateComics will focus on promoting. The annual Ottawa International Animation Festival was founded in 1976 and will take place in September this year. According to the event\u2019s website, it \u201cpresents the world\u2019s most cutting-edge, quirky and important animation \u2013 and transforms Ottawa into the centre of the animation universe.\u201dAlong similar lines, the Ottawa comic book industry received a huge boost last year when the city held its first annual Comic Con event. The world renowned comic book and popculture convention holds events all over the world and sees the biggest names in the industry attend and interact with fans. Although the 22,000 people who attended the event makes it relatively small compared with events in Tokyo and San Diego, which regularly draw crowds of 540,000 and 130,000 people respectively, the organizers considered it a resounding success for the inaugural gathering. This year\u2019s Comic Con event will take place in May and organizers are expecting an even bigger turnout , a true testament to the passion and growth of the industry in Ottawa. The reason for the comic book craze could be attributed to a lot of different things but one of the biggest reasons is undoubtedly the industry\u2019s decision to start marketing to adults. With cult classic graphic novels such as Watchmen and The Walking Dead being targeting an older demographic, the industry has been able to appeal to a much wider section of the population. The co-operation between comic book creators and movie animators has also given the business an increase in appeal.\u00a0 Animation is no longer just Saturday morning cartoons. Animators can now take a wildly popular graphic novel, such as Watchmen and The Walking Dead, and with incredible technological advances, create a visually stunning representation. Those who love the appeal of comics, but not the fact they have to be read, can now sit down and watch them in better quality than they ever before. The business advantages of a partnership like this are obvious and, with Disney buying Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion in 2009, quite substantial. With the industry booming in Ottawa and a continued focus on building it up, the next great comic book you read \u2013 or watch \u2013 could very well be homegrown. ",

The rankings were based on criteria such as the number of new cars bought, employment, house prices, the percentage of residents that cycle to work, and even the unpredictable weather.

    "body": "Jason Chen, Centretown NewsKanata South Coun. Allan Hubley is questioning the use of a private consultant for the city's sponsorship and advertising program. The city\u2019s sponsorship and advertising program isn\u2019t bringing enough revenue in comparison to the original targeted amount, indicates a status report by the city staff, requested by Kanata South Coun. Allan Hubley.\r\rThe program is one of nine strategic initiatives approved by the city in 2011. Its main objective was to achieve revenues of $12.7 million over five years. Revenues were expected to come from naming rights, program sponsorships, advertising opportunities in facilities, websites and other city operations, according to the report. However, in the last year, the program only managed to raise $773,309 \u2013 a shortfall of about $2.3 million from its $3.08-million annual target. The costs for private consultant Centre of Excellence for Public Sector Marketing outweigh long-term values for the city, Hubley says. Negotiations for naming rights between the city and sponsors \u201chave not made the money (the department) thought they would make\u201d with the use of a consultant, Hubley says. \u201cA good percentage of the money that has been raised so far was not raised by (the firm),\u201d Hubley says, referring to the Richcraft Kanata North Recreation Complex agreement worth $500,000, which was negotiated by the city. Hubley says the program\u00a0 should be run entirely by trained city staff, as opposed to depending on outside expertise. The firm currently receives commissions between 15 and 20 per cent of revenues on\u00a0 contracts.Hubley brought his concerns to the finance and economic development committee last week, directing his questions at Dan Chenier, the city\u2019s parks, recreation and cultural services manager. Chenier told the committee that consultants are beneficial to maximize positive results. He says staff and consultants should continue to work together. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking for advice from him on a variety of things (such as) pricing opportunities or industry standards. We can use this consultant as much or as little as we like,\u201d Chenier says, noting the department will focus on clarifying responsibilities between staff and consultants in the following year.Consultants will be delegated more tasks that involve going out and calling for community businesses interested in sponsoring.Chenier also said that the past year\u2019s shortfall was partially offset by \u201csavings in activation and recognition expenditures of $645,043,\u201d making the actual gap approximately $1.7 million.Since the program began, the firm has been involved in more than 130 projects. This includes following up on research, proposals, negotiations and agreements, according to the report. The program has been related to several negotiations directly affecting Centretown residents. It has given exclusive rights to Coca Cola in all city facilities, sponsored the Rink of Dreams with the addition of food concession stands for this year\u2019s Winterlude, and installed a digital screen at city hall to showcase the community champions program. The program kicked off in early 2012 by the city\u2019s parks, recreation and culture department.At the end of the recent committee meeting, Hubley confirmed with Chenier that staff will have an increased leadership role in the remaining years of the program. \u201cIt\u2019s our money,\u201d Hubley says. \u201cPeople of Ottawa express their concerns every day to us (on) how we spend their money.\u201d",

Residents of Ottawa may have noticed a change in the look of some of the city's police cruisers patrolling the streets in the past month, after a miscommunication about the design delayed release the of the new cars.\r\rLast February, the Ottawa Police Service approved the purchase of 58 new Ford Taurus \u201cPolice Interceptor\u201d vehicles to replace some of the aging Crown Victorias that the force currently uses.After a few technical glitches and other temporary roadblocks, about 20 of those cruisers are now roaming the city, replacing any Crown Victoria older than three years or with more than 160,000 kilometres logged.\u201cIt\u2019s not really a question of dumping all the cars on the road right away,\u201d says Ottawa police Insp. Uday Jaswal. \u201cIt\u2019s replacing cars as they need replacing.\u201dThe total cost of the project was $1,621,596, with each car costing $27,958.One of the reasons Ottawa police didn\u2019t immediately start putting the cars into service was because of a problem fitting their existing computer equipment into the Tauruses.According to a March 25 report from the Ottawa Police Services Board, the installation of some of the existing equipment wasn\u2019t possible, and more importantly, the passenger\u00a0 airbag did not deploy with the current setup that the Ottawa police use.Jaswal says the board went ahead with the purchasing of the new cars under the impression that electronic equipment from the Crown Victorias would fit in the new cabin of the Ford Taurus.However, upon receipt of the cars, \u201cstaff noted that Ford had introduced last-minute changes to the Taurus design,\u201d according to the report.The police board then did extensive collaboration with other services in the province to find a solution to the problem, finding that several other departments had the same experience.The fix, a new mounting system for their laptops, will cost $675 per unit for a total cost of $65,000. This money will come out of a budget of $464,000 for works-in-progress.Board chair Coun. Eli El-Chantiry was concerned about the cost, but Jaswal said Ottawa police is talking to Ford.\u201cWe are planning certainly before the purchase of any more Tauruses to have discussions with Ford about that in terms of some of the upfit costs which we\u2019ve incurred,\u201d Jaswal says.Christine Hollander, product communications manager with Ford, said in an interview April 3 that Ottawa police had yet to contact Ford or the dealership where the cars were bought to discuss the issue.She also said that she hadn\u2019t heard of any other police service in North America with this problem.However, Massimo Pari, vice-president of D&R electronics \u2013 the company that created the solution for Ottawa and other services in Canada \u2013 says the other forces knew the problem before purchasing the new cruisers.Ford\u2019s website says it designed the new car with a column-shifter (which is located on the steering column) in order to leave the space for a centre console. The website says the space is the same width as that of the old Crown Victoria \u201cso police agencies can install center consoles from their CVPI (Crown Victoria Police Interceptor) right into the new Police Interceptor.\u201dHowever, Pari wasn\u2019t convinced.\u201cYou can\u2019t take something out of a Crown Vic, how it was set up in a Crown Vic, and say it\u2019s going to fit in a Taurus, because they\u2019re two different vehicles,\u201d Pari says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",

The report showcases areas in which the city has made improvements to web accessibility, and identifies public Internet portals that need work.The report also included a revised accessibility policy for the city, which passed without amendment, Robyn Guest, a senior aid to city manager Kent Kirkpatrick, says of the city\u2019s accessibility office.Special attention is being given to removing barriers to accessibility on city websites. Last year\u2019s accessibility policy included a section on \u201cAccessible Websites and Web Content.\u201d While that focus has stayed the same, this year\u2019s plan outlines more specific ways to achieve online accessibility.The city\u2019s websites are required to comply with provincial guidelines for web accessibility.The guidelines call for two levels of accessibility for websites managed by Ontario municipalities. Level A has to be met by January 2014, and level AA has to be achieved by January 2021.Guest says the city\u00a0 has decided to meet AA specifications ahead of schedule and to bring all of its websites up to that standard by 2014.She explained that having to make corporation-wide changes to meet the A level, and then having to do them again for the AA standard would be less cost-effective.\u201cWe have made a lot of progress just by moving to the Drupal platform, which is a content management system,\u201d Guest says. \u201cAnd that platform has much enhanced accessibility built into it.\u201dDrupal is an open source content management software that the city is using for its online presence.\u201cAll the coding and all of the framework of the website has already been built to WCAG level A compliancy,\u201d Guest says about the new platform.\u201cAnything that\u2019s put into the new system will then be automatically accessible,\u201d Guest says.There is a big difference between a website that has been optimized for accessibility and one that hasn\u2019t, according to Sam Fulton, a blind Ottawa resident and chair of the Eastern Ontario board of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind.Fulton says an accessible website is much easier to navigate for people who use screen readers. Screen readers are software applications that people with visual impairments can use to find information. The applications work by reading text on web pages, allowing people to find links and blocks of text on a website. \u201cEverything on the site needs to have a text component, so even if you\u2019ve got a photo on, at least underneath it there needs to be a tag that explains what it is,\u201d Fulton says.Guest says the city has also gone through an extensive in-class and e-learning program through which they teach writers and editors of online content how to prepare reports and other documents in accessible formats.Guest says the shift toward accessibility has been a big task, but it is going well. She added the city has conducted a lot of testing with members of the Ottawa community and have made major improvements already as a result.She says she hopes the shift toward accessible documents will benefit the entire Ottawa community.",

The historic Chaudi\u00e8re Bridge that spans the Ottawa River and connects Ottawa\u2019s downtown core with Gatineau has been reduced to just two lanes as a result of modernization efforts.\r\rThe bridge carries about 15 per cent of all traffic between the two border cities, functioning as one of the region's key arterial gateways.The closures to the major transit route started on April 1 and are expected to wrap up in late August at the earliest. Public Works and Government Services Canada, the federal department responsible for carrying out the construction, says it doesn't expect to close the bridge completely at any point through the rehabilitation process.In light of serious accidents involving cyclists on busy Ottawa streets in recent years, a number of steps have been taken to accommodate pedestrians and cyclists, says Annie Duguay, a spokesperson for Public Works.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA new temporary sidewalk has been installed for use by pedestrians and cyclists,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see this as a key safety measure.\u201d She adds for the safety of both the public and workers, traffic control and monitoring measures will be implemented.However, some cyclists feel that more needs to be done.\u201cI didn\u2019t really feel comfortable cycling there,\u201d says Hans Moor, president of Citizens for Safe Cycling. \u201cI think they (cyclists) are a bit of an afterthought.

The incurable condition is caused by a combination of genes and environmental factors.Mayor Jim Watson says one of the goals of shining a blue light on city hall\u2019s Heritage Building was to get people curious about the disorder.\u201cPeople will see the building lit up and they\u2019ll ask why,\u201d says Watson. \u201cIt gets people talking about autism.\u201d Light It Up Blue is a global initiative, launched by Autism Speaks in 2010, to raise awareness of the growing health concern. To show support, historic landmarks, buildings and bridges across the world turn blue, the official colour of autism awareness. \u201cAutism is not scary,\u201d says Jody Brenton, of Autism Ontario-Ottawa located in the Bronson Centre. \u201cIt\u2019s not this big, bad thing that everybody thinks it is.\u201dCentretown resident Joanne Small-Greenall has two \u201clow-functioning\u201d children below the age of 10 who are at the severe end of the autism spectrum. Asked how Ottawa ranks in terms of availability of resources for autistic children, Small-Greenall says there are many services available, but not for those who are severely autistic. The programs the government funds tend to privilege those who are \u201chigher-functioning\u201d while Small-Greenall says she has had to fight for resources for kids at the far end of the spectrum. \u201cI know when the government is splitting the bill they think, \u2018Oh we are serving kids with autism,\u2019 but when you actually break that down and see who they are serving, you see there is a huge deficit and huge problem in Ottawa,\u201d she says. Many autistic adults at the lower end of the spectrum tend to live in Centretown so they can access city and community services, according to Brenton. One resource that Autism Ontario-Ottawa offers is a registry for people with autism in partnership with the Ottawa police.Through the program, families can go online and upload a photograph of their child as well as some key information that can help police understand the individual better if an emergency situation arises.The registry started as a pilot program in 2010 after parents and families in the community pushed for it, says Ottawa police Sgt. Jamie Dunlop. In one case, a police officer was able to talk a child into putting down a knife by discussing hockey cards, which he knew from the registry that the boy liked. \u201cThey are not violent on purpose; it\u2019s part of the condition, and knowing what they like can help us communicate better with them,\u201d Dunlop says. The registry also helps police locate autistic children with wandering tendencies.Ottawa was the first city in Ontario to adopt the program and it has since inspired jurisdictions across Canada to implement similar registries. One of the biggest challenges families face is the cost of the services available, because they are privatized, says Dr. Melanie Stewart of Kent Chiro-Med Wellness Clinic at Kent and James streets. Stewart does sensory integration with autistic children. \u201cThese programs are expensive and parents are stressed because they are strapped for cash, but they know their child needs these things,\u201d she says. In addition to raising awareness, World Autism Awareness Day generates funds to support families who are affected by autism. \u201cThe number of people being diagnosed is shocking for all Canadians, and we need to do something to help these kids. Because 20 years down the road our society is going to have a huge problem and who is going to be paying for it?\u201d Small-Greenall asks. \u201cWe need to do something, and having a day dedicated to autism is a good start.\u201d",

    "body": "Ontario residents now have access to a new program to prevent and prepare for instances where people living with dementia wander off and go missing.\r\rThe Alzheimer Society of Ontario recently launched the Finding Your Way Wandering Prevention Program, supported by the Ontario government as part of its Action Plan for Seniors. So far, funding has reached almost $1 million, according to the provincial government. Under the new program, people caring for dementia patients will have access to kits including information for people caring for someone with dementia as well as various services and tools available in case that person wanders off. They will include information about how to access services such as identification forms that can be shared with police in an emergency, safety tips to prevent wandering, and ways to locate a missing person using devices such as GPS or radio signals. Prices vary depending on the services.\"They've taken what was available through the Alzheimer Society and made it better,\" says Wendy Birkhan, a registered social worker and director of operations at Homewatch CareGivers in Ottawa.The program is unique because of its wide, multilingual reach and how it concentrates information and services into a single place, says Joanne Dyson, spokesperson for the Alzheimer Society of Ottawa and Renfrew County. The kits are available in English, French, Cantonese, Mandarin and Punjabi upon request from local Alzheimer Societies in Ontario. Another service highlighted in the kits is the MedicAlert Safely Home program where caregivers can register someone with dementia so their information is kept in a database. The person is given identification jewellery such as a bracelet with a hotline number so that if they wander off, anyone who finds them can determine who they are and where they live. This is important because the person with dementia may not be able to communicate this information, Dyson says.This type of identification can keep individuals out of hospitals, which can be stressful environments, where they are currently taken if they are found and unable to communicate. \"At the hospital, they're often traumatized. They are exposed to germs. They are disoriented,\" Birkhan says.These services also help address the fact that there are more seniors living alone than in the past as people have fewer children and live apart from them, says Dominique Paris-MacKay, director of Age Friendly Ottawa at the Council on Aging of Ottawa. \"It creates a situation that wasn\u2019t there in the past where children were around to help parents,\" she says.The number of Canadians living with dementia is increasing as the nation's population ages. \"Age is the biggest risk factor in developing Alzheimer's or other dementia,\" Dyson says.She adds the risk of dementia doubles every five years after age 65. Another reason for this increase is that more cases are being identified as the ability to diagnose dementia improves, she adds.Canada is not prepared to handle this growing phenomenon, Paris-MacKay says. There are an estimated 15,000 people living with Alzheimer's or other dementia in Ottawa and Renfrew County, while there are about 2,500 additional cases each year. Dyson says she expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.Currently, three out of five people with dementia go missing at least once, Dyson says. Among the number of people missing for more than 24 hours, half of them suffer a serious injury such as exposure, dehydration, or hypothermia. Yet, most of those missing are usually less than 2.5 kilometres away from where they were last seen, she says. Raising awareness about wandering is important for people caring for someone with dementia as well as the public, Birkhan says. \"Families think it's a one time occurrence when their loved one has been lost,\" she says, \"And it's by chance that they've come home.\"The Ontario Police College will also be involved in the new program by raising awareness among officers about people with dementia and wandering, says Dyson. The kits will also be available in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese next year.",

    "body": "Community groups and the Ontario government are trying to make it easier to find fresh food in Centretown.\r\rThe Ontario government introduced legislation in March called the Local Food Act that would see local foods brought to 25 per cent of its 1,500 buildings. If passed, the act will promote local foods at schools and hospitals, as well as grocery stores and restaurants. A new report by Just Food and the Centretown Community Health Centre says Centretown residents have seen a need for fresh and affordable produce, especially since there is such a mixed demographic. Since the community is so ethnically diverse, some people aren\u2019t able to afford local produce because of their low incomes. The Where\u2019s the Food Project was drafted by Just Food after members of the Centretown community recognized there was a shortage of places to find fresh foods, says Aleksandra Milosevic, community developer at the CCHC. She says the report was used as a \u201cmapping exercise\u201d to highlight and find out what was already in the neighbourhood.It found that community gardens are a way for residents to \u201cwork together to create something that they will all benefit from.\u201d Nanny Goat Hill Community Garden is a popular garden located at the corner of Bronson and Laurier avenues. Bethany Guenther-Peter, co-coordinator at the garden, says having locally grown produce that\u2019s easily accessible and affordable is vital for Centretown because of the lack of fresh options. She says many members of the community buy a membership for a plot at the garden and grown their own tomatoes, herbs and exotic vegetables. However, because of the high demand for plots, she estimates only five open per year and there is a waiting list of 80 people. Centretown resident Josh Martin says he is going to try his hand at gardening on the balcony of his Bank Street apartment for the first time. The building management of his apartment has opted to give tenants free plants so they can grow their own vegetables and herbs. Martin says gardening will help him eat healthier, but will also save him a lot of money. \u201cIf we\u2019re making one meal, we don\u2019t necessarily need a massive bundle of basil, we just need one or two sprigs. So this is going to allow us to use exactly what we need and waste a lot less,\u201d he says. For those not able to grow their own produce, Guenther-Peter says another option is purchasing fresh foods at the Good Food Market, which will be held three or four times during the summer at Nanny Goat Hill garden. The food will come from local farms.The market, started by the Poverty and Hunger Working Group, aims to bring affordable produce to communities that wouldn\u2019t normally be able to buy it. Anyone is welcome at the market, but ideally people coming would cycle, walk or take public transit, says Guenther-Peter. ",

Since then, the Elementary Teachers\u2019 Federation of Ontario has been in discussion with the provincial government to find a solution and make an agreement between the parties. The discussion is regarding \u201citems of concrete importance to our members,\u201d said federation president Sam Hammond in a statement on March 26. The key discussion items were released by the\u00a0 federation early this month. These include topics such as maternity leave benefit enhancements, sick leave and job security for non-teacher federation members. Details of the agreement are yet to be finalized.Pending the final agreement, all 76,000 members of the federation\u00a0 must vote to approve the contract. The original announcement from the federation lifting the advice for teachers to not participate in extracurriculars came on March 26. Elementary school teachers and students in Centretown will be able to get back to their clubs, fieldtrips and after-school activities with an agreement finally reached. But it is still unclear if schools will restart programs they were not able to maintain with only a few months of school left.Elementary schools will be working with their principal and staff members to implement the best response of resuming activities, says McKenzie.\u201cSchool is about academics but it\u2019s also about student well-being. There\u2019s a connection to the school spirit when students participate in activities other than the classroom activities,\u201d says McKenzie. Extracurricular activities can be linked to social skill development, teamwork and an outlet for stress, experts believe. When the teachers stopped volunteering their time, community members stepped in to help out where they could. \u201cSome students and parents did pick up leadership roles during that time and we\u2019re going to continue to operate both with teachers and community members in extracurricular activities,\u201d says McKenzie.

But the danger and adrenaline on which Luke has built his life prefigure his fate, and soon he is robbing banks for money in order to fund a future with Romina and Jason.His ascension as a notorious criminal precipitates an unavoidable collision course with the law which introduces Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), a rookie officer destined for hero-cop status after taking down Glanton. Cross\u2019s own ambition to be more than a beat cop is stymied by ruthlessly corrupt colleagues in the department, even as his feelings about the Glanton case are complicated by the fact that he has an infant son the same age as Glanton\u2019s.But 15 years later, as Avery runs for attorney general, his son AJ (Emory Cohen) crosses paths with Jason Glanton (Dane DeHaan), setting in motion another series of confrontations that continue the film\u2019s preoccupation with generational conflict, troubled fatherhood, and the fact that everyone gets their hands dirty eventually.Though he disappears from the proceedings midway through, Ryan Gosling dominates The Place Beyond the Pines to the point where it is tempting to treat the entire film as a showcase for him, particularly as its debut comes shortly after his announcement that he was taking a break from acting (though he subsequently clarified he only meant \u201ca break to direct\u201d). Combining bits of his previous roles in Blue Valentine (in which he charted another troubled relationship under the direction of Derek Cianfrane) and Drive (with bikes swapping in for cars as the getaway vehicles of choice), Gosling creates a new and memorable antihero vaguely reminiscent of Edward Norton\u2019s Derek Vinyard in American History X.Dane DeHaan delivers another authentic performance as a conflicted adolescent, Eva Mendes as a conflicted mother displays a mixture of scrupulousness and vulnerability, and Bradley Cooper is believable as a true-blue peace officer with his own paternal issues \u2013 Harris Yulin appears as his father, a judge who manifestly prefers the idea of a son who had stayed in law school instead of joining the force.But Emory Cohen stands out as the would-be gangsta teen from a wealthy white family, convincing to the point of upsetting plausibility because his presence is that of a particularly surly hoodlum from The Wire.If the narrative machinations are notably unsubtle \u2013 the flimsy motivation for the bank heist sub-plot comes complete with a speech appraising Luke\u2019s \u201cunique skill set\u201d \u2013 the action always carries weight, from a thrilling chase to a series of violent encounters, each with different stakes.Even the languorous moments of inaction are made atmospheric and infused with meaning thanks to Sean Bobbitt\u2019s deliberate cinematography and a score by American musician Mike Patton which combines classical and ethereal choral music \u2013 charting the stately passage of time \u2013 with ambient synthesizer tones that flare into harsh discord to underline ugly moments of tension and violence.If the payoff of a final confrontation is not ultimately worth the drawn-out, multi-generational set-up \u2013 the kids\u2019 stories didn\u2019t have to begin at infancy \u2013 there is plenty of resonance parceled out along the way as the tripartite story patiently unfolds.The fundamental triteness of The Place Beyond the Pines is something that only crystallizes afterward; to experience it, even as it dawdles in parts, is to visit a fully realized world of the director\u2019s own (Cianfrance co-wrote the story as well) where the dividing lines of the class system stand out a little more sharply and the power of a gun is undisputable.\u00a0",

The new plan, aimed at responding to today\u2019s urban issues, includes recommendations for building height, green space, transportation, heritage and mixed-use development.Though the plan was completed over three years, with the final draft delivered this February, the report saw some last-minute tweaking just days before it reached council.The Centretown Citizens Community Association did not approve of an arrangement that would have allowed for extremely tall buildings along select downtown streets, as long as these structures included public amenities. The city has since established a height cap of 27 storeys \u2013 the same maximum allowed for the tallest Centretown buildings.The CDP originally did not define the maximum height for these \u201clandmark buildings,\u201d but they still had to respect NCC guidelines. \u201cBecause that has created concern in the community that there was not a defined maximum, staff felt it prudent to establish such a maximum to remove uncertainty,\u201d said city planner Robert Spicer in an email.

This new idea, dubbed \u201csmall moments,\u201d will allow for some extra height in exchange for amenities such as green space.Though council approved this motion, the CCCA, as stated in an email to city councillors prior to the meeting, wants height limits in the mixed-use, mid-rise area limited to nine storeys with no exceptions.Holmes introduced a third motion to restrict commercial spaces in small buildings in Centretown\u2019s core. Holmes wants the area to remain strictly residential, as it has been for the past 30 years.

Still, the association\u2019s board members urged for the CDP\u2019s \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d to be addressed.The community association called on the city to, in part, scale back potential building height in certain areas.

    "body": "The history of Ottawa\u2019s plight to host a casino may be a short narrative, but it\u2019s packed with drama and controversy.\r\rLocal health centres and community organizations have called on council to shoot down the gaming hall.And now that Mayor Jim Watson has taken a downtown location off the table, some businesses are upset, as Watson had previously said that all sites would be considered.Watson himself originally endorsed the idea of a casino in the city\u2019s core. But, in a letter to council members last week, the mayor said the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation would only allow one casino in each \u201cgaming zone\u201d \u2013 meaning the city would lose slots at the Rideau Carleton Raceway if it established a casino elsewhere.Watson therefore wants council members to back the racetrack as \u201cthe only acceptable location for an expanded gaming facility in Ottawa.\u201dOttawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk has criticized Watson for flip-flopping on the issue. Melnyk is touting Scotiabank Place as a good home for the gaming hall, while the Sparks Street Business Improvement Area, wanting to attract more customers, would like to see the casino downtown. But Watson has \u201csupporters\u201d in the Centretown Community Health Centre and, according to a poll administered by the Centretown Citizens Community Association, many local residents. They\u2019d rather see no casino at all, but believe changing the locale is the right thing to do.The CCCA\u2019s poll found that residents overwhelmingly oppose the idea of Ottawa hosting a new casino, with the majority responding that \u201cpublic health and social costs such as gambling addiction will be too significant.\u201dBut most respondents said that if a casino were to come to town, it should be at the Rideau Carleton, away from the city\u2019s core.\u201cIf what the mayor wants comes to pass, we think it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d says Jeff Morrison, board president of the Centretown Community Health Centre.The health centre\u2019s biggest concern since the casino was first proposed has been the question of increased access to gambling. But moving the casino to a place where there is already a gaming facility mitigates this problem.\u201cThe easier you make it to access gambling,\u201d he says, \u201cthe more the likelihood that problem gambling issues will arise.\u201dProblem gambling impacts certain groups more than others, with seniors, urban aboriginals, and young men being among the most vulnerable. \u201cWhen you look at the population of downtown,\u201d he says, \u201cthose are the kind of populations we have there.\u201dThe health centre launched a petition on June 10, calling on city council members to oppose the casino expansion.Members of Ottawa\u2019s business community, as expected, have a very different opinion of Watson\u2019s new stance. Some are now lamenting that, if the mayor has his way, they won\u2019t benefit from the hot upcoming attraction, which could be a major draw for tourists.Les Gagne, executive director of the Sparks Street BIA, describes Ottawa as a \u201cvery passive tourist destination,\u201d but says a downtown casino might have helped liven up the city\u2019s core.Ideally, says Gagne, Sparks Street would be home to the new gaming hall, but any downtown location would satisfy him.\u201cIt certainly would have given us a real neat opportunity to bring a lot of vitality and excitement to downtown,\u201d he says. \u201cBut also people that wouldn\u2019t otherwise come downtown would be given an incentive to do so.\u201dGagne says the city\u2019s core quiets down after public servants leave for the day, but a new casino would bring in a steady stream of people downtown after work and on weekends. But this idea of an influx of cash and new customers isn\u2019t realistic, according to Lori Mellor, executive director of the Preston Street Business Improvement Association, who says the organization didn\u2019t want the casino in its neighbourhood.\u201cIt isn\u2019t the draw that it once might have been, these casinos. They\u2019ve gone very down market,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are not attracting tourists. They have lost the cachet.\u201dCasinos, actually, tend to \u201csuck all the money from the area they\u2019re in,\u201d she says, as patrons don\u2019t usually visit local merchants \u2013 they just spend their money in the casino. \u201cThere are no spillover benefits.\u201dWatson hasn\u2019t gotten his way just yet.

But the community association wants the neighbourhood\u2019s core to remain strictly residential. Centretown tenants, says Charbonneau, are already within close distance to local merchants, so a mixed-use designation isn\u2019t necessary.The design plan also allows for tall buildings \u2013 up to 27 storeys \u2013 in mid-Centretown, if developers include public amenities, such as green space. The CCCA also wants this struck out, as the idea was added in the late stages of the plan\u2019s development, says Charbonneau, and was never subject to public consultation.Somerset Street, between O\u2019Connor and Elgin streets, has been dubbed a \u201csecondary mainstreet,\u201d allowing commercial uses in heritage houses and at the base of apartment and office buildings. But the CCCA wants this stretch of Somerset to remain primarily residential.The Ontario Municipal Board recently confirmed the CCCA\u2019s request for an appeal.In August 2012, the CCCA filed an appeal to the OMB regarding council\u2019s approval of a condo tower at 96 Nepean St. That issue was eventually settled through mediation between the community association and the developer.",

    "body": "Colin MacGregor JohnstoneCheryl Angenent walks out of the Greater Ottawa Health Advocacy Centre, a newly opened marijuana shop on Somerset Street West.  Since opening on Somerset Street West last week, a medical marijuana dispensary has attracted both controversy and a flurry of interested clients. \r\rThese are people such as Cheryl Angenent, who can tell you the date of her life-altering car accident without taking a beat. It was Aug. 23, 1989. She was 18 years old.\u201cI had multiple skull fractures, broken neck, broken back, broken legs, and broken feet,\u201d she recalled, as she stood outside the newly opened Greater Ottawa Health Advocacy Centre.She had permission to possess marijuana in Oregon, but the form is now outdated and she doesn\u2019t have a doctor, so she left the centre empty-handed. Health Canada mandates that those needing medicinal marijuana must have a signed declaration from a doctor.The government department announced last month that it will stop producing and distributing medicinal marijuana in April 2014. Licensed users will no longer be allowed to grow their own product and will have to obtain the drug from federally licensed growers.Ryan Levis, owner of the Greater Ottawa Health Advocacy Centre, told the media that the shop did sell to customers not medically certified, though it has since started selling to certified clients only.Today, clients left the shop, not with what they came for, but forms to be filled out by family doctors.\u201cIt\u2019s a dead end,\u201d said Bob Jamison of the new process. \u201cThey say to go see your doctor and fill out a form. Unfortunately, not a lot of doctors are on board with medical marijuana.\u201d \u201cAny medical professional that you go to will not provide you with medical marijuana permission,\u201d said Angenent, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t consider it medicine.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough family doctors,\u201d said Dr. Mark Ujjainwalla, an addiction medicine specialist who stopped by the shop out of curiosity. \u201cThere are lots of people coming in who bona fide need medical marijuana. In fact, there are people who have the licence, but it\u2019s expired. But they can\u2019t find a family doctor who will sign their forms for them.\u201d Jamison, who has glaucoma, said it is easier to buy on the street than to cut through the red tape. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201cthat money I spend on the street goes to finance many, many other criminal activities.\u201dAngenent said she has no trouble getting marijuana on the street. \u201cI walk through the market with my dog and my dog will pick up the smell,\u201d she says.She is a patient at a transitional clinic for those who do not have family doctors, so she is hoping to get permission from there.There is no consensus as to whether the store is licensed to distribute the drug. CBC reports that Levis says he is federally licensed and the Ottawa Citizen reports that Levis has said he has applied for one, but Health Canada has not approved any yet. Centretown News was turned away from the shop by Cameron Lodge, who identified himself as a part-owner and manager and said the shop is \u201ccomplying with all federal rules.\u201dCTV News reports that Health Canada says it has not issued a licence for the store.Ujjainwalla is attempting to organize a legal, medically-run, medicinal marijuana program, which he described as \u201ca very difficult process.\u201d ",

The Energy East Pipeline, which still needs regulatory approval, is anticipated to begin deliveries to Quebec by 2017 and deliveries to New Brunswick by 2018.\u201cThis is an historic opportunity to connect the oil resources of Western Canada to the consumers of Eastern Canada, creating jobs, tax revenue and energy security for all Canadians for decades to come,\u201d TransCanada president Russ Girling said in a news release.The pipeline will be used to transport resources from Alberta\u2019s oil sands \u2013 or \u201ctar sands,\u201d a plan that worries Ecology Ottawa. The not-for-profit group describes the proposed venture as \u201call risk and no reward for the resident of Ottawa.\u201dTar sands oil is thicker, more toxic and possibly more acidic than light crude oil, which makes it prone to spills. This heavy form of oil also makes cleanup difficult as it sinks in water.Girling said the Energy East project \u201cwill be designed and operated with a singular focus on safety\u201d and oil resources will be \u201ctransported safely and reliably.\u201dEcology Ottawa says the explosion of an oil train in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Que. highlights the \u201crisks of shipping oil near people\u2019s houses and sensitive ecosystems.\u201d Though that oil was not transported by pipeline, the group says that, over the past 20 years, Canada has seen an average of more than 100 pipeline spills per year, while the U.S. counts about 250 on average.In 2010, a rupture of a 40-year-old pipeline in Michigan flooded the Kalamazoo River with about 3.8 million litres of tar sands oil.The Energy East project would \u201cthreaten the sensitive ecosystem of the Rideau River,\u201d says the group, \u201cwhich flows into the Ottawa River, with a major spill,\u201d and could damage the farmlands and ecosystems surrounding the city.The group \u201chad never planned on fighting a tar sands pipeline,\u201d said executive director Graham Saul at an Ecology Ottawa meeting on Tuesday.But the group has already garnered nearly 2,000 signatures on a petition to halt the project and has several other campaigns underway. It is also pushing its supporters to let their representatives know that they oppose the project.In the recent Ottawa South by-election, Liberal candidate John Fraser and the provincial Green Party rejected the pipeline.Still, Liberal MPP Yasir Naqvi and NDP MP Paul Dewar have not addressed the issue, but Saul is trying to reach out to them. \u201cThere\u2019s no good reason for them not to be opposing this pipeline,\u201d Saul said in an interview.Many supporters attended Ecology Ottawa\u2019s meeting at the Sandy Hill Community Centre, which Saul said shows the community\u2019s concern about the pipeline.Ecology Ottawa\u2019s upcoming events to oppose the project include information sessions, a rally and a benefit concert to raise funds for the campaign.\u201cRight now, what we\u2019re really trying to do is find our friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying if you\u2019re out there and you care about this problem, contact us, join us, and we\u2019re going to build momentum to demand of our elected leaders that they represent us on this issue.

Council voted to put an end to the policy on July 17, just one day after developer Jordan Tannis submitted the application for 186 James St. Still, completed applications received by the city prior to July 10 will be processed. The property is currently a single-family triplex, but Tannis plans to convert it into a multi-unit apartment building. The existing front of the building will be maintained, but a new addition will be constructed on the side. Units will be a combination of single, two-bedroom, and bachelor suites.The opposition group, Friends of James and Bay, is concerned that not providing parking spaces for the building\u2019s new tenants will force more residents to park on the street, leading to overcrowding, especially in the winter.\u201cThe parking already in the area is saturated,\u201d said the group\u2019s Robert Brando, at a Wednesday public meeting at the McNabb Community Centre. University students are out right now, he said, so on-street parking is not as dense. \u201cBut come back in December, come back in January.\u201dA July 16 application submitted to the city says the low-rise apartment building will include 15 units.

    "body": "A simple set of yellow flashing lights along the curved roadway where an OC Transpo bus slammed into a VIA train last week could have prevented the deadly crash, a rail safety expert says. \r\r\u201cIt would have been one more protective measure,\u201d David Jeanes, president of Transport Action Canada \u2013 a public transit lobby group \u2013 said this week.Jeanes said cities in Ontario are in the habit of putting up sets of advance yellow signals before traffic lights hidden by hills or bends. In fact, Jeanes said there\u2019s already an advance yellow warning light before the rail crossing on March Road in Kanata. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that they should be doing that also for the Transitway at Fallowfield Station,\u201d he said.He said that when buses leave the station to head north, they face a curved road lined by trees and shrubs, hiding the train crossing.\u201cEven before the curve stops, you\u2019re already at the railway tracks,\u201d he said. Officials from the Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, said the gates and red lights at the site of Wednesday\u2019s collision, which killed six people, had been activated for 45 seconds before bus number 76 barrelled through them. Jeanes said 45 seconds would have allowed plenty of time to turn on an advance yellow light and for the bus driver to stop.Regardless of what TSB finds in its final report, Jeanes said installing flashing yellow lights before the crossing near Fallowfield Station \u201cmight be common sense just to do anyway.\u201dJeanes explained that red stop signs are also absent from Ottawa railway crossings because road signage is regulated by Ontario\u2019s driving laws. He said the Highway Traffic Act doesn\u2019t mention rail signage.Train crossings \u2013 and the signs around them \u2013 are regulated by rail companies and Transport Canada. And shoving a stop sign into the ground at the six road-level train crossings in Barrhaven alone might just create more headaches, Jeanes said. \u201cThere may be an hour with no trains, and if every vehicle has to come to a full stop, then the capacity of your road is significantly reduced,\u201d he said.The gap between federal and provincial laws also means that it\u2019s up to each city in Ontario to decide whether it wants its buses to stop, like school buses, at all railway crossings. For example, the Toronto Transit Commission has a policy that forces bus drivers to make a complete stop at all grade-level train crossings, regardless of whether the barriers are down.A spokesperson for the Railway Association of Canada \u2013 a lobby group that speaks for rail operators across the country \u2013 said that because the feds are reviewing the rules that govern road-rail crossings, he was unable to comment on safety measures.However, the group said in a press release following Wednesday\u2019s crash that \u201crailways encourage amalgamations and closures of unnecessary crossings, high safety standards for the others, and strictly limiting new crossings to locations where no alternatives exist.\u201dOne option is to get rid of grade-level crossings altogether by digging out underpasses for traffic. But according to Jeanes, \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money for that\u201d in Ottawa. Plans to redesign the crossing near Fallowfield Station got the axe in 2004 when crews discovered that the soil in the area contains flowing water.\u201cIt could have put houses in Barrhaven at risk of damage to their basements,\u201d Jeanes said.Mayor Jim Watson said councillors will be talking about what can be done to improve rail crossing safety at next week\u2019s council meeting.\u201cIf there are things that our staff believe we can do in the interim before we even get an interim report from the TSB, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll ask them to bring forward on Oct. 2.\u201dThe final results of the TSB investigation could take up to a year to finish, but Watson said he\u2019s met with board executives who told him they won\u2019t wait that long to suggest urgent changes to the city\u2019s rail crossings. \u201cAnd that was comforting,\u201d Watson said.

Discussions about replacing a parking lot with a city park on McLeod Street will not materialize into real grass and trees. To the disappointment of the residents in the area, the City of Ottawa\u2019s attempt to buy the parking lot from the Hulse, Playfair and McGarry Funeral Home failed after the bid was turned down by owner Brian McGarry. \r\r\u201cThere was some time spent looking into the matter,\u201d says Scott Miller, senior director at Hulse, Playfair and McGarry. \u201cThe value that the city appraised the land at is lower than what we had anticipated. Therefore, at this time, there are no further discussions about the possibility of establishing a park here at the corner of McLeod and O\u2019Connor,\u201d Miller says.Three weeks ago, the city sent a formal offer to McGarry but the businessman was not content with the $4.2 million the city \u2013 according to Peter Hume, chairman of the city\u2019s planning committee \u2013 was willing to pay for the parking lot that is just over a third of an acre. Miller, who confirms the figures, says he doesn\u2019t believe that negotiations will continue anytime soon. He says the city will have to offer more money for that to happen. \u201cI think it would have been a nice spot down here at the corner to have some green space in a park but I understand the city are dealing with costs and funding.\u201d The Centretown Citizens Community Association hoped for a different outcome. \u201cWe are disappointed. Hopefully, the city and Mr. McGarry will be able to get back together and rethink what the value of the property could be,\u201d Robert Dekker, vice-president of the CCCA, says. \u201cWe were excited by the prospect that there would be additional greenspace in Centretown. With all the expansion and the increase in density in Centretown, any additional greenspace is good for the environment and livability,\u201d Dekker says. The area around McLeod and O\u2019Connor streets already has a park. On the opposite corner from the McGarry parking lot, the western lawn of the Museum of Nature is a popular spot for local residents. But proponents of a greener Centretown say they don\u2019t appreciate the way some things have evolved. A big part of the lawn will be taken away with the creation of a parking lot. Suzanne Snell, a resident in the area, says she would appreciate more places to walk her dog. \u201cOf course, I would love to see a new park there (on the McGarry property),\u201d Snell says, who then turns her attention to the nearby Museum of Nature.\u201cBut I am more upset about this one over here. I\u2019m furious with what the museum has done, and I think I speak for everyone in this area when I say that,\u201d she adds. Originally a temporary addition, the much-discussed parking lot was recently made permanent by the museum when the possibility of building an underground parking facility was deemed too expensive.\u201cMore and more people live here. There is very little green space for the children to be and to walk your dog,\u201d Snell says.As outlined in the official Community Development Plan for Centretown, city council intends to construct one or two new park spaces in the area. Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes who was on the negotiating team with the funeral home did not respond to requests for an interview. \u00a0",

At a recent meeting, the city\u2019s finance and economic development committee recommended that city council issue a letter supporting the organizations in its application for funds from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities\u2019 Green Building Fund.Now that the city has given the green light, Grant says they have a better chance of getting the funding they need to put the plan in motion. \u00a0\u201cWe want to diversify the building type and just think about the street-level space, make it a more vibrant space that\u2019s more attractive to employees, and to residents and to visitors to the city.\u201dSkyscrapers such as the 49-year-old MacDonald Building on Slater Street, which will be vacated by April of this year, are perfect candidates for the initiative because they could be renovated under new, eco-district standards to be more environmentally friendly, says Karen Pero, one of the volunteers with the initiative and a spokesperson for Invest Ottawa, the city\u2019s tax-funded economic development agency. \u201cIt allows the opportunity to make them LEED certified,\u201d says Pero.Leadership for Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a rating and certification system that recognizes eco-friendly building design, construction and operation. \u201cFrom the Invest Ottawa point of view,\u201d says Pero, \u201cthe number of the kind of companies we would want to attract to Ottawa \u2013 the larger corporations or the progressive companies really \u2013 are very keen to be in green buildings.\u201dCompanies leasing the offices are not the only ones that will reap benefits from the certification process, says Pero. Building owners will get an advantage, as well. \u201cThe research has indicated that companies that lease green buildings usually lease for a long period of time.\u201d While much of the initiative is focused on big companies becoming more eco-friendly, Pero says focusing on smaller community operations is also a big part of the eco-district proposal. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to be able to partner with every one from very large corporations to people that live in downtown Ottawa and the mom and pops,\u201d says Pero. \u201cFor a number of us, it\u2019s personal because we live in Centretown. We want to be able to do our part to help our community.\u201d Grant says this grassroots approach has garnered support from local community groups as well as politicians at all levels of government. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to have this initiative taking place in Centretown,\u201d says Jordan Charbonneau, president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association. \u201cThe novel thing about an eco-district (is) it recognizes how cities actually work and the organic nature of that development.\u201dThough it may take several years before all parties approve the proposal, Grant says it\u2019s the right time to be starting this kind of initiative. \u00a0",

    "body": "Annie Rooney, 2011 A field of potentially dangerous wild parsnips. Wild parsnip, a weed that causes burns to people\u2019s skin \u2013 and in some cases blindness \u2013 is a problem that needs to be dealt with more quickly in areas around Ottawa, including Centretown, city councillors say.\r\rThe plant, which blooms yellow flowers, contains a harmful sap that reacts when in contact with the skin. If an infected person then touches their eyes, this could result in blindness. \u201cThe whole plant is dangerous,\u201d Mike Yee, a biologist at the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority, says. \u201cThe sap, which is all over the plant, is photo-reactive with ultra-violet light, meaning it burns the skin.\u201dThe plant matures during June and July and this is when a majority of the cutting takes place. Coun. Marianne Wilkinson says she believes\u00a0 city council needs to keep on top of the issue so that it is more manageable next summer. \u201cThere are big areas around the city. I think we need to start working there to make them peaceful lands instead of just being places for weeds. If they just cut it in June they would get it out the way,\u201d she says. The solution to the problem of wild parsnips is to cut them down or pull them out before they produce the poisonous sap. Larry O\u2019Keefe, the city\u2019s manager of parks, says \u201cthe best option, in my interpretation, is to pull the plant out manually. That gets the root out, so it doesn\u2019t regenerate. The next would be to cut it because that way, at least it\u2019s not continuing to grow. Pesticides will stop it growing but not remove the root, so it can still regenerate.\u201dWilkinson says she believes wild parsnip, which began as a rural problem, has become urbanized, as the plant has been found in some public walkways and behind houses in the city. \u201cI get complaints from people that wild parsnips are continuing to grow where their children play and they walk their dogs. I think the city has to start taking responsibility for maintaining their own lands in the urban area. We need to keep on top of the growth.\u201dO\u2019Keefe, however, says there is already a lot of work being done by the city to tackle the problem in public spaces. \u201cIn public areas like parks, we make sure we take care of the wild parsnips and we have a park maintenance program,\" he says.\"There are some areas around the city that we keep in a natural state, these are not in maintenance. But if someone complains about there being wild parsnip growing in an area near them, of course we will see to it.\u201dThe city also runs a health education program so that people can be made aware of the problem of wild parsnips and how harmful they can be. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful so far,\u201d O\u2019Keefe says. \u201cPeople are becoming more aware of the problem. Every time there is an announcement, either by the council or the media, it alerts more people to the issue and we get an influx of calls from people reporting the plant growing near them.\u201dDiane Downey, also from the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority, agrees that more needs to be done to educate people. \u201cThe plant is appearing in such large quantities. People from urban areas are completely unfamiliar with it. I think educating people on the dangers is more of a concern than the actual cutting of the plant.\u201dAs autumn progresses, most of the wild parsnips have died. However, as the plant is a perennial, it will return to Ottawa parks next summer, and remain a cause for concern unless the city is more vigilant in its efforts to remove the offending plants. ",

    "body": "The bitter taste left by the controversial slaying of an elk in Centretown earlier this month is raising questions about the strategy that the City of Ottawa uses in dealing with wildlife conflicts.\r\rThe male elk wandered into a grassy area next to the Bayview O-Train station in the early morning on Oct. 8 and left Ottawa Police, NCC staff and onlookers stunned at the sight of the large animal near the downtown core.After many hours during which it was decided that NCC staff could not get close enough to tranquilize the animal effectively, the animal was shot dead. The outcome stirred confusion and anger among many of those watching the drama unfold. Ottawa-Carleton Wildlife Centre director Donna Dubreuil condemned the elk-shooting. \u201cThis has happened with the city before and many times, I think, we expect the city is going to better the next time. But they don\u2019t. This was an opportunity for Ottawa to do it right and it didn\u2019t.\u201dThe shooting of the elk came only months after city council implemented a new wildlife strategy in July to deal with such large-mammal conflicts.Dubreuil helped lead a petition when the city implemented its new wildlife strategy and expressed concern that the report would be handled by the rural and agricultural committee which, she said, had nothing to do with urban wildlife issues.The plan, initiated in 2010 to help deal with beaver and increasing coyote populations around the National Capital Region, yielded numerous recommendations as to how the city should deal with biodiversity and wildlife conflicts.In April 2013, a draft report outlined the need for a specific \u201cWildlife Resource Officer\u201d \u2013 or biologist \u2013 to deal with ecological issues around Ottawa.The report stated that \u201ceffective implementations of the recommendations in the wildlife strategy cannot happen without a dedicated staff position\u201d and \u201cthe creation of a Wildlife Biologist position appears justified by the size of the city\u2019s natural areas, the diversity of the challenged, and public interest and concern for wildlife issues.\u201d The position, however, was deferred in the July final draft for discussion until 2014 while the city monitors the results of other approved recommendations in the report such as an \u201cUrban Wildlife Speaker Series,\u201d primary school wildlife programs to be presented at Carleton University and the University of Ottawa, and updated protocols for growth and planning management in Ottawa. Currently, the city does not have a specific positionInstead it relies on authorities on the scene or experts ranging from a variety of departments \u2013 such as the NCC, which\u00a0 oversees biodiversity and conservation around the Ottawa/Gatineau region along with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, which manages ecology on crown property \u2013 and outside agencies \u201cwho may incidentally possess some experience and expertise\u201d outside of their job descriptions, the report said. Would a specific city biologist officer have helped in the elk incident? Neither city officials or the Ottawa Police provided a clear answer.Courtney Ferguson, a media manager with the city, explained the general role of the potential biologist. \u201cThe Wildlife Resource Officer position is intended to reduce human-wildlife conflicts over the long term by implementing public information campaigns as well as projects aimed at reducing conflicts involving beavers and coyotes.\u201dOttawa Police spokesman Const. Chuck\u00a0 Benoit reinforced the mandate for public safety first by officers at the scene. \u201cIt happened and the decision was made so I can\u2019t go back and be an armchair quarterback and saying, \u2018It would\u2019ve been better this way or that way.\u2019 At the time, a decision was made for certain reasons, and we can\u2019t go back on that.\u201d The issue, for Dubreuil, was not whether a biologist officer would have helped, but rather the city\u2019s attitude to wildlife conflicts. Dubreuil says he thought that the way that Ottawa Police allowed numerous spectators to hang around the elk to snap pictures elevated the stress of the animal, \u201cThat\u2019s creating some of the panic too when you have people standing around taking pictures. That creates a lot of the problems.\u201dDubreuil said that deferring the Wildlife Resource Officer position in the final report only allowed the city to keep doing what it has always been doing with wildlife issues, \u201cOttawa has a very warped attitude, I think, when it comes to how they deal with wildlife but I think it\u2019s more and more increasingly out-of-step with public opinion.\u201dNoting that elk are most active in-between dusk and dawn, Dubreuil suggested, that perhaps, the police should have waited until night-time when there were less spectators and the elk may have moved away from the city.",

    "body": "Ontario doesn\u2019t let teens buy cigarettes, so why does it let them use tanning salons?\r\rThat line of reasoning has helped pass a bill at Queen\u2019s Park that prevents minors from using tanning beds in the province.Bill 30, titled \u201cThe Skin Cancer Prevention Act,\u201d contains a host of measures aimed at limiting the health risks of indoor tanning. When the new law, passed on Oct 9, comes into effect later this year, it will outlaw coin-operated self-tanning beds, require salons to provide patrons with health information and check ID for younger-looking customers. Fines for not obeying the law range from $5,000 for individuals to $25,000 for large businesses.One in six Ottawa residents between the ages of 18 and 24 has admitted to tanning in the past year, according to Ottawa Public Health nurse Diane Desjardins. She says that body image, self-esteem and the influence of celebrities and television shows all encourage young people to pursue the sun-kissed look. \u201cWe know that education is important and health promotion is important but much like tobacco, we need legislation,\u201d says Desjardins.Ottawa Public Health has been pushing for the ban since the World Health Organization declared in 2009 that tanning beds and lamps are capable of causing cancer. Centretown News reported in 2009 that the City of Ottawa was lobbying the provincial government for a ban. Anti-tanning bills have a five-year history in the province, with a similar bill introduced but not passed in 2008. Another bill was brought forward last year but died when Premier Dalton McGuinty prorogued the legislature. Ontario is the sixth province to ban minors from tanning, joining Quebec, B.C., P.E.I., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.Andy Boznar, owner of the downtown UTAN salon, says he sees a lot of student traffic, but has always required parental consent for minors. He doubts the new law will have much of an impact on his business.Still, when it comes to anti-tanning laws, Boznar is divided as a business owner and as a parent \u2013 but not in the expected way.\u201cFrom a business standpoint I encourage it because it\u2019s going to help regulate the industry and create a more professional environment,\u201d he says.\u201cBut from a parent\u2019s perspective, as I am, I\u2019m appalled by it. I don\u2019t want any government agency telling me as a parent that I don\u2019t have the right to bring my 17 year-old son or daughter in for a couple tanning sessions before going on vacation.\u201d Boznar says the law \u201cdoesn\u2019t address the real problem. The real problem is our industry has not been regulated successfully.\u201dAlthough personally he doesn\u2019t agree with the full ban, he concedes that removing self-tanning beds and cracking down on the \u201cbad apples\u201d of the industry is a positive step. University of Ottawa student Kailee O\u2019Connor says she starting tanning at 15. Now that she\u2019s older and more informed about the risks of skin cancer, she says the law is a good idea.\u201cPutting a law in place definitely helps. When you\u2019re older you can make an informed decision, given the health risks,\u201d she says, although she still has friends who tan occasionally.",

The committee\u2019s approval on Oct. 10 ensures renewal of the heritage site after years of being supported by steel braces and covered in tarps, graffiti and boards.\u201cWhen the back of the building fell, it was a sad moment for everyone in the community,\" says Coun. Jan Harder. Bank Street and the battles that occurred for months after, this is truly great news,\u201d says Harder, who chairs the Built Heritage committee.Shahrasebi purchased the building in 2005 and launched a renovation plan in 2007 in an attempt to restore the building. On Oct. 19, 2007, while a work crew was in the basement, a key support was knocked out, partially crumbling the southeast wall. The collapse trapped a worker in a Bobcat for nearly two hours while police, firefighters, and paramedics attempted to rescue him.After the collapse, the police closed four city blocks that surrounded Somerset House. Barricades from O\u2019Connor Street to Kent Street, and from MacLaren Street to Cooper Street restricted vehicle and pedestrian traffic for two months as engineers braced the structure so it wouldn\u2019t disintegrate onto passersby. This ended work on the building, prompting a series of lawsuits between the city and Shahrasebi over who was responsible for public-safety costs. This legal entanglement was finally settled last December when Shahrasebi agreed to pay the city $650,000 in policing and firefighting costs, and to end a countersuit. The city decided to waive additional encroachment fees.Nearly a year after the settlement, council successfully approved reconstruction plans from architect Derek Crain. The plan aims to maintain the building\u2019s heritage look by refurbishing the brick and traditional exterior details of Somerset House\u2019s Bank Street fa\u00e7ade while modernizing the newer section on Somerset Street.Both parts of the building were approximately the same height but the older section had three tall floors while the newer section squeezed in four. A glass wall and ceiling will replace the upper story of the Somerset Street section. The plan also includes a completely new, modern interior and the addition of bay windows and an ornamental corner tower.\u201cThe Somerset House was built in the early 20th century, so we want the design to be contemporary and distinguishable while being sympathetic to the heritage character of that time,\u201d says Sally Coutts, planning co-ordinator of Ottawa Heritage Planning Services.\u201cWe want to enhance the building\u2019s classic properties.\u201d The refashioned Somerset House will likely feature retail space at the street level with office space on the upper floors, The plan still needs approval from the planning committee and city council. The owner will have two years to complete the project.",

    "body": "The Ottawa police now have an official policy to address mass demonstrations, arrests and a plan for a temporary mass prisoner \u201cprocessing centre\u201d if needed. \r\rThe policy, passed by the Ottawa Police Services Board on Oct. 28, was drafted in response to Judge John W. Morden\u2019s independent review of police actions at the G20 summit in Toronto in June 2010.Dubbed the Morden Report, the 2012 review has many recommendations the board has adopted for this city\u2019s policy, such as a procedure to address the rights of large numbers of prisoners. A review team comprised of members of the police board as well as the Ottawa police met on four separate occasions and discussed the recommendations proposed by the Morden report. These recommendations were passed in March, and on Oct. 28, the following Major Events Policy was passed. Ottawa police chief Charles Bordeleau, according to the policy document, will ensure the procedures will be \u201cin accordance with current Canadian legal standards.\u201dThe operating plan for the \u201cmass prisoner processing centre\u201d is to be created in a way that will take special consideration of the Youth Criminal Justice Act as well as a separation of male, female, transgendered and transsexual prisoners, according to the new city policy. Morden\u2019s review and recommendations followed the mass arrests, detention and incidents of police misconduct towards protestors and bystanders during the 2010 G20 protests in Toronto. The Ottawa Police Services Board used the release of the Morden Report as an opportunity to review the police procedures in this city that were already in place with respect to major events.\u201cGiven its role as the nation\u2019s capital, Ottawa experiences a great number of political protests and demonstrations such as the Tamil, Congolese, occupy Movement, and Idle No More demonstrations and marches,\u201d stated a staff report presented at the Oct. 24 police board meeting. The policy also affects major political gatherings held by the federal government, such as the G-series international summits. When it comes to what implications this policy may have for future events, police board executive director Wendy Fedec says she doesn\u2019t think members of the public will see many differences.To Fedec, the policy is more administrative in nature. It assures the Ottawa police will get into a dialogue with the police board.\u201cIt tells the chief: you must involve the board in this situation,\u201d Fedec says. Fedec says most protests held in the city don\u2019t measure up to what would be defined as a significant major event.\u201cThese measures are for extraordinary events,\u201d says Fedec, making reference to international summits. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to impact the hundreds, if not thousands of major events held in the city.\u201dRob Dekker, outgoing vice-president of the Centretown Citizens Community Association, says these measures might be used in circumstances similar to when Confederation Park was taken over by Occupy protestors in October 2011. Dekker says he thinks there will be opposition from citizens upon hearing news of the city policy.\u201cSometimes there are innocent bystanders and victims who get caught up in this,\u201d says Dekker.Ottawa police Insp. Mark Ford, who works in the force\u2019s emergency operations directorate, says there have been six events in the last decade where a secondary detention site was required in addition to the holding cells at the main Elgin Street police station. Though the new city policy makes the creation of a temporary mass processing facility official, the city has witnessed the impromptu opening of such a centre in the past as well.\u201cWe actually do have plans for (temporary detention centres),\u201d says Ford, \u201cbut now it\u2019s a policy, not a plan. The difference is in the wording.\u201dWhen asked where the planned facility would be located, Ford said he couldn\u2019t divulge details.But he says the Ottawa police once set up a site on Catherine Street at a maintenance facility not far from the Elgin Street headquarters. He says they wouldn\u2019t use that spot a second time.\u201cProtests of a peaceful nature can devolve into violence and we need contingencies,\u201d says Ford. \u201cWhen these events happen elsewhere, we seize the opportunity to examine the issues and ask if we are prepared. It gives us an opportunity to validate what we currently do, or if there is a gap.\u201dFord mentioned the 2011 Stanley Cup riots in Vancouver and how that city\u2019s police force was unable to communicate effectively with a large, emotional crowd.",

With the winter approaching, some Ottawa residents are facing a choice between four walls and a full stomach. \r\rThis is a trend local food centres may not be able to keep up with.Officials with the Centretown Emergency Food Centre say they\u2019ve seen a dramatic increase since last year in the number of individuals and families accessing its services. The situation is creating a crisis, says Kerry Kaiser, co-ordinator of the Bank Street centre located in the basement of Centretown United Church.\u201cWhen you\u2019re serving families with large amounts of children, you\u2019re dealing with a huge increase in your food costs.\"The centre\u2019s staff has also noticed a decrease in donations. Clients get emergency food once a month and if they return they get a smaller scale emergency bag. In response to the rising number of clients, the centre will be eliminating this second service in the new year, Kaiser says.\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for the worst for 2014, and we\u2019d be fools not to,\u201d says Kaiser, warning the change will affect families the most because the second bag tends to be used for children\u2019s lunches.The growth in clients runs parallel with subsidized housing built in Centretown, Kaiser says, such as Beaver Barracks.Between January and September 2012, the centre served 7,062 clients, and within that number, 848 families. During the same nine months in 2013, the Centre served 8,103 people total, and 1,197 families \u2013 a year-over-year increase of 41 per cent in families, according to centre statistics.The centre plans to continue supporting these individuals and families by buying food in a new way, through grocery wholesalers, Kaiser says. This new method would make the most of donated funds.\u201cThere\u2019s no fat to trim. The only thing we spend money on is food.\u201dFran Klodawsky, a professor at Carleton University with expertise in housing and other social policies, says food centres are serving a group unable to afford rent and adequate amounts of food at the same time.A person earning minimum wage spends 46 per cent of his or her earnings on rent for a bachelor\u2019s apartment, according to Klodawsky. She adds that for people living on social assistance, that level of rent would cost more than their entire earnings, meaning they need food banks to supply necessities.As Christmas approaches, Kaiser says she expects many in Centretown will have a hard time paying their bills. \u201cWe have a huge demand and with that demand comes fear. There\u2019s not a parent we don\u2019t deal with who isn\u2019t worried they\u2019re not going to provide Christmas for their children,\u201d says Kaiser.Looking forward, Kaiser says the city should make sure there are meal programs available seven days a week, especially as colder temperatures lead to higher heating bills for families across the city.",

    "body": "Centretown residents are calling for more driver and pedestrian awareness two weeks after a driver struck a 24-year-old man at the busy intersection of Bank Street and Laurier Avenue. \r\rStephane Cousineau, 24, was taken to hospital with chest and abdominal injuries after the Oct. 30 incident. Police later charged Michael Chettleburg, 73, with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm, and assault with a weapon. The intersection has been deemed one of the most difficult to navigate in Ottawa because of segregated bikes lanes on Laurier, its restrictions against turning right on red lights, and the abundance of pedestrian traffic due to its key location among the stores, restaurants and office buildings of downtown Ottawa.But Christine Leadman, executive director of the Bank Street BIA, says the incident is not reflective of the work that has already been done to improve the intersection. \u201cIf you come to the intersection you will see the crossings have different treatments on the sidewalks and that the curbs have been extended, making it easier for people to cross quicker.\u201d Leadman says that the intersection can be challenging to navigate due of the volume\u00a0 of traffic. \u201cYou have pedestrians and cyclists all converging on that one street and there are a lot of things that are going on,\u201d she says. \u201cThe city\u2019s role here should be in public awareness about these intersections that have these cycle path routes but also the fact that there are pedestrians that are crossing.\u201d The segregated bike lanes on Laurier Avenue have been in place since July 2011, when they were implemented under a two-year pilot project. Rob Dekker, co-chair of the planning committee for the Centretown Citizens Community Association, says there is still confusion among drivers about rules governing the intersection of the bike lane and roadway.\u201cEven after two years I think there is still some getting use to as which way the traffic is going,\u201d he says. \u201cIt does make it busier than normal intersections, which will add to the level of danger.\u201dSome residents have said that because segregated bike lanes prevent right turns on red lights, more drivers are impatient with pedestrians crossing the street. The City of Ottawa\u2019s website on the project says that turning right on red lights would conflict with the left-turn bike boxes, which is an extension of the bike lane that allows left turning cyclists to move in front of vehicles stopped at a red light. \u00a0Dekker says he agrees with the city\u2019s ruling on the intersection. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see what would happen if we take that away and we allow right hand turns on a red light. Then all of a sudden we might be causing further incidents which could cause people harm.\u201d Catherine Gaudreau, communications co-ordinator for the Canada Safety Council, says pedestrians themselves need to be aware of the potential incidents that could occur. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for motorists to be mindful if there are pedestrians at crossings to be watching for pedestrians. But also pedestrians have the responsibility of ensuring their own safety,\u201d she says. Transport Canada\u2019s website says that 16 per cent of all fatalities on Canadian roads in 2010 were that of cyclists and pedestrians. In that same year, 17 per cent of all serious injuries on Canadian roadways were that of pedestrians and cyclists.Ottawa Police say the investigation regarding last month\u2019s incident is still ongoing. The segregated bike lanes, however, are not going away. City council voted in July to maintain the lanes on Laurier Avenue after what it deemed a successful pilot project.",

Sgt. Rob Bernier, co-ordinator of the force\u2019s emergency operations directorate, says it\u2019s possible future protests and public events may warrant the need for police to use these devices. \u201cCommunication is a major challenge in major events and disasters,\u201d says Bernier. \u201cIt becomes challenging to get (voice messages) both loud and clear enough to go the distance you need.\u201d Along with the city\u2019s recent Major Events Policy, LRADs are part of a larger effort by police and city officials to modernize and improve police procedures with respect to what police call \u201cpublic order operations.\u201dOther large-city police forces have had LRADs for a few years now. Although not used during the 2010 G20 protests in Toronto, the police had LRADs on hand in case they were needed. As the capital, Ottawa sees scores of major demonstrations every year. \u201cSome of them are a bit more volatile than others, and sometimes it would have been really nice to provide some direction to the crowd,\u201d says Bernier, pointing to the 2011 Occupy protests as an example.Ottawa Police now have two LRAD 100xs and one LRAD 300x, all kept at the force\u2019s Barrhaven station. Bernier says the 100x \u2014 small enough to be strapped to an officer\u2019s chest \u2014 costs about $8,000, while the larger, 28-pound (12.7-kg) 300x costs about $18,000. The manufacturer, California-based LRAD Corp., calls its product a \u201csonic weapon,\u201d because it can also send out loud alarm tones that can be ear-piercing and incapacitating.There are rules in place in Ontario that forbid the use of the LRAD as a sonic weapon. However, according to the Police Services Act section on acoustic hailing devices, \u201cthe use of an alarm or alert tone on an acoustic hailing device to get the attention of members of the public is communicating.\u201d Wendy Fedec, the executive director of the Ottawa Police Services Board, says the board made amendments to its policy on acoustic hailing devices earlier this year so that it is in line with the provincial rules regarding their use.\u00a0\u201cIt (the LRAD) can only be used as a communication device,\u201d says Bernier. Bernier says their procedure with respect to the LRAD\u2019s \u201calarm\u201d function is a brief three- to five-second tone, followed by a voice message. But the LRAD is a powerful device, and there are valid health concerns with its use, police acknowledge. If used improperly, sounds emitted by the LRAD could cause hearing damage or loss. He says there are a handful of officers who attended a full day course on its use.As an example of its power, Bernier says when the LRAD 300x is turned to full volume, no one can be within 75 metres of the device. Mark Calzavara, regional manager of the Council of Canadians\u2019 Toronto chapter, claims the LRAD was designed primarily as a weapon used to disperse people, pointing to the events that took place four years ago in Pittsburgh as an example.Bernier says the LRAD can be used for marine search-and-rescue operations, where the 1.5 kilometre hailing distance could be particularly useful. He says the LRAD can be used in other circumstances, as well: hostage situations, suicide attempts and tactical operations. ",

Local Filipinos, still reeling from the impact of typhoon Haiyan on their homeland, are grateful for the outpouring of support from the Ottawa community. \r\r\u201cThe response from the community has been quite touching. A lot of people have come forward to help,\u201d says Rev. Pedro Arana, pastor of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish in Vanier. Following the devastation of the super storm that killed thousands and left victims in desperate need of aid, various groups around Ottawa have been collecting food, clothing and donations for the ravaged nation. Assumption Church has been in the forefront, holding special Sunday masses to raise funds for relief efforts.According to Arana, the parish\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t gone unnoticed, as many new faces from the Filipino community have come to the church to lend support. The parish has held various events for donation collection throughout November, including a recent concert showcasing local Filipino talent. \u201cWe are still figuring out what we can do in the long run, so that we can reach victims not only for relief, but rehabilitation. I think the greater impact on the victims is how they survive in the aftermath of this disaster,\u201d says Arana. The Assumption church will continue to plan fundraising events until the end of December. The typhoon has personally affected parishioners who have relatives in the Philippines. \u201cOne member has been looking for three brothers. They have only found two,\u201d says Arana. One of the roles of the church has been establishing communications with representatives from affected areas and receiving updates on the well-being of relatives. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the names of parishioners\u2019 relatives, so that we can contact them when we go over there,\u201d says Emie Fairweather, a volunteer and parishioner at the church. Fairweather hopes to travel to the Philippines early next year with her husband to help with the relief efforts. \u201cThank God all of my relatives are safe, because they are in Manila,\u201d says Fairweather. The typhoon damage in the capital city of the Philippines wasn\u2019t as devastating as it was in Tacloban, the worst-hit city. According to Fairweather, the church has had a lot of support from both the Filipino and English-speaking communities. The Assumption congregation isn\u2019t the only group in Ottawa getting involved with relief efforts. Eric Tamayo, first at the Philippine embassy, says he\u2019s grateful for the outpouring of support in Ottawa from groups such as the Carleton University-based radio show, Tinig Pinoy. The show has been broadcasting schedules for events organized by the various fundraising groups around Ottawa. Tamayo says he\u2019s pleased with the federal government\u2019s decision to match the amount of money that is collected through donations in Canada. Tamayo says that one of the embassy\u2019s main roles has been encouraging various sectors to donate to charitable organizations in Canada and highlighting the fact that the government has put up this special matching fund, effectively doubling the amount of donations from individual Canadians. The fund will match donations until Dec. 8. \u00a0\u201cWe are really heartened by the outpouring of support coming from Canada. Canada was among the first to respond in the wake of the typhoon,\u201d Tamayo says.Aside from Ottawa, Tamayo says that donations have been received from all across Canada, from the provincial governments and various other groups. \u201cThese donations really do go a long way in facilitating the delivery of goods to the areas affected,\u201d he says. The Canadian government has also sent the Disaster Assistance Response Team to the Philippines, where they are helping with reconstruction efforts and providing much-needed aid in affected areas. ",

    "body": "Ashcroft Homes will go back to the drawing board after learning its construction plans for a major redevelopment project on Sparks Street would threaten preservation of the building\u2019s original 19th-century facade. \r\rAshcroft withdrew its application to demolish the building at 106-116 Sparks Street and construct a six-storey building in its place at the built-heritage subcommittee meeting in November. Construction of a brand new 18-storey building facing Queen Street was also part of the plan. City officials say a number of unanticipated structural problems were found during analysis of the building on Sparks Street and the company made the decision to withdraw their application and establish a new time frame for redevelopment. Coun. Jan Harder, chair of the heritage committee, says the company found the facade would be at risk if it remained in place during construction. She added that the city is working with the NCC to make sure the building is properly sealed for the winter to ensure the crumbling structure doesn\u2019t deteriorate further.But few details were provided about the nature of the problems with the aging facade, or what proposed solutions might be.\u201cWe won\u2019t know the exact nature of the [new] proposal until we receive the application,\u201d Harder says. \u201cWhen another application is received we will analyze it and judge it on its merits.\u201d The NCC initiated the project \u2013 deemed Canlands A \u2013 to redevelop the land in 2006, eventually signing a 66-year lease with the developer in 2008. One of the requirements outlined by the NCC under the terms of the agreement includes the development of \"mixed-use\" land at the site, with space available for both retail and residential units. But the property lies within the Sparks Street Heritage Conservation District, making it more difficult for land developers to gain approval for major development projects in the area. The agreement requires Ashcroft to retain the building\u2019s existing facade in its current position during construction of the new six-storey building, and eventually restore it. Responsibility for redevelopment remains in Ashcroft\u2019s hands despite the problems found at the site according to C\u00e9dric Pelletier, who works in real estate and asset management with the NCC. But he pointed out that any proposed plan would require both city and NCC approval before the project could move forward. \u201cThis asset is federal property, so with any project or application on federal properties in the capital region, this one will need to go through the usual NCC federal approval process on land use and design,\u201d Pelletier says. He says he expected the heritage facade would be reinstated in accordance to the history and character of the area, as \u201coutright demolition of the building is not an option in the redevelopment of the site.\u201d Any new project must include \u201cimportant architectural details and materials worthy of Sparks Street and Parliament Hill,\u201d Pelletier says. A number of delays have plagued the project since the application was first submitted in June. Ashcroft failed to deliver necessary development documents to the city in September and the project never made it back onto the agenda earlier this month. Niki Choo, vice-president of Ashcroft Homes, says that although the company is making all efforts to preserve the facade, \u201cit is in worse condition than we previously thought.\u201d Choo provided few details about Ashcroft\u2019s plans, but said the project will continue \u2013 despite the withdrawal of the application. No time line was given. \u201cWe are actively working on resubmitting, working closely with our partners to ensure a successful restoration of the facade,\u201d Choo says. Harder says an application is expected in the new year and that the 90 day timeline will be established upon the city\u2019s receipt of a complete package. The building was built between 1870 and 1875 as a commercial and retail space.",

Officers were previously only required to fill out a report if the Taser was actually fired. Officers will also undergo an additional four hours of training with CEWs under the new guidelines, bringing the total to 12. The ministry made the changes to the guidelines three months after the province\u2019s move to provide local police services more discretion over deciding which officers are permitted to carry CEWs. Formerly, the use of the device was restricted to specific officers and police teams.Police services across Ontario overwhelmingly welcomed the announcement. In a recent press release, Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said CEWs \u201chave been an effective option for officers involved in situations where use of force is necessary.\u201d Police forces in Toronto and Hamilton have also expressed their willingness to expand the use of CEWs among their ranks since the province gave municipal forces the go-ahead to equip more of their officers with the devices in August. Andrew Morrison, a media relations representative with the ministry, says his department \u201chas always taken a cautious and measured approach to the use of CEWs.\" Morrison explained that increased training for officers includes scenario-based and judgment training, which includes de-escalation skills in conflict situations and interaction with persons suffering a mental illness. \u201cPolice officers also receive training on responding to persons with mental illness that includes tactical communications, excited delirium syndrome awareness, rapport building and mediation, and the Mental Health Act,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cAs with all use-of-force options, adequate procedures, training and accountability mechanisms are necessary to ensure they are used effectively and appropriately.\u201d But some groups have expressed concern over the use of Tasers generally by city police, and are worried about Ontario\u2019s increasing support for the technology in recent months. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association urged police forces to invest more in facilitating mental health and disability crisis response teams, \u201crather than additional weaponry,\u201d in a press release issued after the province\u2019s August announcement. \u201cCCLA has long-standing concerns about the safety and appropriate uses of CEW\u2019s,\u201d says Sukanya Pillay, acting executive director with the organization. \u201cWe recognize that in certain extreme cases there may be legitimate law enforcement uses of CEW\u2019s, for example to prevent imminent harm or death. However CCLA is also aware and seriously concerned that CEWs have been misused in the past.\u201d The CCLA could not be reached for comment before publication. The Canadian Mental Health Association pointed to evidence from other jurisdictions in the United States and British Columbia, showing that expanded use of CEWs has resulted in \u201cusage creep\u201d \u2013 and that Taser use may be a tool of first resort.Although the association was encouraged to hear that amendments to use-of-force guidelines will now include specific training for interaction with people living with mental health issues, the release explained that individuals experiencing a serious mental illness are at higher-risk of heart-related health issues, a risk which \u201ccould be exacerbated by CEWs.\u201dOttawa police had yet to allocate funds specifically for additional stun guns when they sent their budget to city council earlier this month, but a police report detailing future use of CEWs and recommended purchases will be submitted to the Ottawa Police Services Board early in 2014.

However, two years ago it was announced that the synagogue would be sold due to financial difficulties.The initial buyer, Claridge Homes, walked away from its offer to buy the property in early 2013. A few months later, Trinity Properties Investments Inc. struck a deal with the congregation. At the end of March 2014, the synagogue will be permanently closed and Trinity will begin a condo development.However, no location has been found to replace the current synagogue, leading to concerns about where many Jews living in downtown Ottawa will be able to worship. David Kardish, congregation member and owner of the nearby Rideau Bakery, says that the future is uncertain for Beth Shalom.\u201cI have no idea where they\u2019re heading, neither do they,\u201d says Kardish. \u201cEverything is in flux right now, but you\u2019ve got to keep looking forward to the future.\u201dScott Goldstein, director of the Jewish student organization Hillel, says that this sale leaves few options available to those looking to worship in downtown Ottawa.\u201cIt being the only Conservative synagogue in the area is going to have an impact,\u201d says Goldstein. \u201cSomeone downtown who lives walking distance to that synagogue now has to find a new location, and there\u2019s only one other conservative synagogue in town, Agudath Israel.\u201dThere had been ongoing merger talks with Agudath Israel, located on Coldrey Avenue in Carlington. However, in a joint statement released to members of the two congregations earlier this month, the task force announced that due to issues such as \u201ccurrent needs, existing clergy and issues related to governance,\u201d an agreement could not be reached.There is also a much smaller Orthodox synagogue, Ohev Yisroel, located just a few blocks down from Beth Shalom, on Rideau Street. However, Goldstein says that it is unlikely many members of Beth Shalom will be willing to make the switch to an Orthodox congregation.\u201cI can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I have a feeling that there won\u2019t be too many people moving from a Conservative to Orthodox synagogue,\u201d says Goldstein. \u201cThey want something they\u2019re used to, with a similar outlook to their religious practices.\u201dWhile the future is still uncertain for the congregation, there have been some steps secured to assure that members of Beth Shalom will continue to worship together. Centrepointe Theatre, located on Centrepointe Drive in Ottawa\u2019s west end, has been booked as a venue for celebrations of the the High Holy Days, in the event that a location cannot be secured by then.However, the pain of losing an historic venue such as the location on Chapel Street, and the uncertainty of the congregation\u2019s future, has left many members discouraged. Addressing the congregation, Beth Shalom president Ian Sherman said that the relocation process has been a long and difficult one.\u201cI feel as though I am in the midst of a new exodus \u2013 the exodus of Congregation Beth Shalom from Chapel Street,\u201d wrote Sherman. \u201cMoreover, it will not be any dictator such as Pharaoh who tries to decide the plight of the Beth Shalom people; rather it will be the people of the Beth Shalom family who determine whether we want to carve out our future together.\u201d ",

The origin of the superstition is not certain. Some think it began because the disciple Judas \u2013 the betrayer of Jesus, the Bible says \u2014 was the 13th person seated at the Last Supper. Fear of Friday the 13th is an actual phobia for some people. It\u2019s called \u201cparaskevidekatriaphobia.\u201dBut Darren McKee just doesn\u2019t buy it.\u201cHow does a particular Friday become very negative just because it falls on a number that humans use to keep track of days? It doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he says.McKee is one of the hosts of \u201cThe Reality Check,\u201d a weekly podcast that looks at a variety of issues through the lens of rationality. The podcast began five years ago and has more than 5,000 listeners each week. The online radio show is produced by the Ottawa Skeptics, a group which seeks to debunk superstitions through reason and scientific method. The group has more than 400 members. In addition to the podcast, they host monthly talks and \u201cDrinking Skeptically\u201d social events.Other groups have existed throughout history that sought to overthrow superstitious beliefs.In 1882, civil war veteran Capt. William Fowler founded the Thirteen Club which tried to defy the belief that the number 13 is unlucky by meeting in groups of 13 on the 13th of the month. They walked under a ladder to get into the meeting and decorated the room with open umbrellas. McKee says worrying about bad luck on Friday the 13th is silly.\u201cWhy would the day of the week \u2013 Friday \u2013 matter at all? People generally seem to love Fridays,\u201d he says.Alex Campbell, a psychology student at the University of Ottawa, says superstitions are a form of self-fulfilling prophecy. People notice only the bad things that happen on the 13th because it reinforces their pre-existing belief that the day is unlucky. If good things happen, no one notices. But even though Campbell knows the psychology behind superstitions, she says she still follows them.\u201cI know that I\u2019m being silly, but I do it anyway,\u201d she says.She says she first became superstitious when she got involved in community theatre. Theatre people are notoriously superstitious, she says. They think saying \u201cgood luck\u201d will jinx a performance and instead say \u201cbreak a leg.\u201d Even though it might not make a difference, she says: \u201cWhy not avoid it just in case?\u201dBut superstitions are not only personal. They also affect the community at large.Hotels and apartment buildings traditionally do not label a 13th floor because of the superstition. Seventeen of the 20 tallest buildings in Ottawa are located in Centretown. These include three hotels \u2013 Minto Suite Hotel, Ottawa Marriot Hotel, and the Delta Ottawa City Centre \u2013 none of which label a 13th floor.McKee believes this custom is illogical but also understandable.\u201cIf enough customers prefer to stay in hotels without the number 13, then it is a wise business decisions to just skip the number.\"However, Campbell says she wouldn\u2019t even want to stay on the 14th floor. \u201cIt\u2019s just the 13th floor in disguise. It\u2019s not fooling anyone,\u201d she says. New high-rise condominiums are being constructed in Centretown. Will they have a 13th floor? Even if they do, according to the skeptics, nothing bad will happen.Knock on wood.",

The resizing and reconstruction of the Elgin Street school was initially part of the OCDSB's January 2011 \"capital priority listing.\" There are eight schools on the priority list for the OCDSB\u2019s five-year funding plan.While the Elgin Street rebuild was identified as a priority, a working group has also recommended that the board take steps to reserve land for a future school in a central or near-west location, possibly Centretown or Hintonburg.Need will arise for a new school as the \u201ccity\u2019s policy of intensification continues and many of the older schools become too costly to repair and maintain,\u201d according to the report.The document also calls for a further review of the Centretown area aimed at \u201cmaintaining programming important to these communities as well as assessing the desirability of adding Early French Immersion programming.\u201dAccording to school board chair Jennifer McKenzie, whose trustee zone encompasses Centretown and includes such elementary schools as Cambridge Street, Elgin Street, Glashan and Centennial, the proposed rebuild is \u201cmostly to do with the capital planning, so it\u2019s the infrastructure,\u201d rather than a revamping of the school\u2019s programming.The working group and OCDSB staff have held about 20 meetings to discuss ways to address overcrowding, with a proposed solution that favours a realignment of boundaries. According to McKenzie, downtown schools are more on the \u201cperiphery\u201d of those discussions and should not be as affected as much as the so-called Near West schools.Board officials are also wrestling with the fact that Elmdale and Devonshire schools west of Centretown, struggled to keep their doors open 10 years ago, are now thriving with much-sought-after EFI programs. Today, there is limited space for enrolment and officials are considering new boundaries for the schools.According to the working group\u2019s proposed plan, Cambridge Street Public School would be the only Centretown school affected Under the proposal, children in the English program from junior kindergarten to Grade 6 at Elmdale Public School would be relocated to Cambridge, Connaught and Hilson schools. Catherine Pacella, co-chair of the Elgin Street Parent Council took part in the accomodation review. She says she has not heard much about the planned rebuild.\"It really is one of those things where it's identified as a priority but there's no date or schedule,\" she says. \"It's just identified as a priority and then in due course hopefully something will hapen.\"Trustees on the committee are scheduled to debate these issues further before the final plan goes to the full board for approval on Jan. 28.",

The entire \u201ccapital experience\u201d branch of the NCC, which was charged with planning and running Winterlude among other responsibilities, was transferred to the federal government department.On Dec. 16, the federal department released its program of activities for this year\u2019s edition of the annual mid-winter festival. While Winterlude classics like ice carving and snow sculptures will stay, they will feel the impact of a stronger focus on shared Canadian heritage that will dominate the festival in 2014. Winterlude 2014 will mark the 150th anniversary of the Charlottetown and Quebec conferences, for example. Veterans Affairs officials will light an ice sculpture in Confederation Park to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War. Canadian sports enthusiasts can celebrate the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics or 50 years of ringette in Canada with activities in Jacques Cartier Park. According to the department, the goal of the festival is no different from years past. \u201cThe objectives are what they\u2019ve always been for the past dozen or so years. We\u2019ve been recognizing and celebrating Canadian milestones at Winterlude and that continues this year,\u201d says Denise Leblanc, Winterlude spokeswoman for the heritage department.The department\u2019s mandate is to \u201cwork together to promote culture, the arts, heritage, official languages, citizenship and participation as well as Aboriginal, youth and sport initiatives,\u201d according to the department's website. With features including series of art exhibits in Confederation Park, an Aboriginal village, a kid\u2019s zone and winter-sport workshops in Jacques Cartier Park, Winterlude fits well within the Canadian Heritage mandate, says Leblanc. Winterlude is inherently important to Canadians and their heritage, she says.\u201cWinterlude celebrates the essence of being Canadian in winter. It\u2019s not even just about surviving the outdoors and making it through winter, but it\u2019s about gathering people together, gathering your community together, getting out there and spending time in the great outdoors,\u201d says Leblanc.The department of Canadian Heritage is not alone in planning and putting on the festival.\u00a0Despite losing its responsibility for Winterlude, the NCC remains involved in the festival in a number of ways. \u201cThe National Capital Commission is a partner for Winterlude,\u201d says Emily Keogh, communications officer at the NCC.The NCC still provides the three official sites for Winterlude activities, which are the Rideau Canal Skateway, Confederation Park and Jacques Cartier Park.\u201cIt is our job to ensure these spaces are prepped and maintained before, during and after Winterlude,\u201d says Keogh.The NCC is also running a number of Winterlude activities, according to Keogh.The NCC is only one of more than 90 Winterlude partners, according to Leblanc. She says this is the highest number of partners in the history of the festival. These include other federal government departments, the City of Gatineau, the City of Ottawa, foreign embassies and local businesses.Winterlude 2014 activities will take place across the national capital region from Jan. 31 to Feb. 17.",

    "body": "Twelve of 61 retirement homes registered in Ottawa do not have automatic sprinkler systems, according to Ottawa Fire and Safety Services.\r\rStatistics provided by the agency show that all of the retirement homes registered within Centretown have the systems installed.In the wake of the deadly fire that claimed the lives of at least 24 people at a retirement home in L\u2019Isle-Verte, Que. last month, fire safety systems at senior care facilities in Ottawa have been under scrutiny. A provincial regulation that took effect on Jan. 1 requires any senior care facility in Ontario without automatic sprinklers to install them by 2019. The law was passed by Queen's Park last spring.McLeod Retirement Home, at 330 McLeod St., has a resident capacity of 72. Building owner Claude Brunet says he installed automatic sprinklers in the facility in 1999, and they've been inspected each year since.Brunet says that because residents at retirement homes may not be well enough to move around by themselves, fire safety procedures are of particular importance to plan how to properly evacuate residents who may use wheelchairs or walkers.\u201cLots of retirement homes have special floors which deal with patients who have Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Brunet says.\u201cAt McLeod, all the residents have to be self-sufficient . . . We provide care, but they have to be well enough to say, dress themselves.\u201dHowever, the new regulations don\u2019t just apply to retirement homes, but also to nursing homes and all facilities which provide care for seniors.Marc Messier, spokesperson for the Ottawa Fire Services, says the 12 retirement homes still lacking the upgraded fire safety systems will join a larger list of other businesses and facilities which fit the criteria of the new regulations as well.These include nursing homes, hospitals and hotels which provide long-term senior care.\u201cWe have 232 residences in the city of Ottawa that are affected by this new law . . . All of these businesses will be checked by our inspectors on a yearly basis.\u201dSt. Vincent Hospital, located at 60 Cambridge St. N., is owned and operated by Bruyere Continuing Care. The Ottawa based medical care company has facilities around the city dedicated to caring after seniors, especially those with serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s.Although it is not classified as a retirement home, the hospital provides long-term care to seniors, thus fitting the criteria of the new regulations.Merille Kirouac, facilities manager at Bruyere, says the St. Vincent building underwent major renovations from 2002 to 2006.\u201cThe sprinkler system is a major component of our fire suppression system,\u201d Kirouac says.With residents who would need extra help to evacuate in the event of a fire, Kirouac says they have a more than adequate staff to patient ratio which meets provincial evacuation standards.One of the facilities without a complete sprinkler system is The Palisades, a retirement home run by Toronto-based Symphony Senior Living. Bordering on Centretown at 480 Metcalfe St., The Palisades holds 154 units and has a maximum resident capacity of 200.Facilities like The Palisades will have to upgrade their systems, since the new regulations mandated that all retirement homes in the province must have automatic sprinklers installed everywhere in the building, including all resident\u2019s suites.Symphony Senior Living president, Lisa Brush says that her company acquired The Palisades building last year, as well as The Redwoods at 2604 Draper Ave. Since the purchase of the two buildings last year, Brush says Symphony has been working on upgrading its fire safety systems.Brush says both the buildings, at the time they were purchased by Symphony, had either partial sprinklers or weren\u2019t up to the standard the company would want them to be when looking after frail residents.\u201cThe investors have agreed to put (automatic sprinklers) in at all properties,\u201d Brush says. \u201cAs you can imagine both buildings with partial sprinklers, there\u2019s quite a bit of engineering work to be done.\u201dAlthough it depends from building to building, partial sprinklers can mean that only some areas or some resident\u2019s suites have automatic sprinklers.Brush expects the fire and safety systems at The Palisades to be upgraded within the next 12 to 18 months.Though building owners still have until 2019 to upgrade their safety systems, Messier says a lot of buildings are starting to install them already because they know the liability protection and benefit of having them installed.",

Ottawa\u2019s polluted old industrial sites may be cleaned up with echinacea \u2013 a flower normally used to cure colds \u2013 after a research project carried out on Victoria Island showed \u201cpromising\u201d signs that the plant can help break down toxic soils.\r\rA number of properties monitored by the National Capital Commission are not used because of contaminated soil.. \u201cNow the NCC is searching for natural ways to clean these areas,\u201dsays University of Ottawa researcher Jules Blais. \u201cThey are especially interested in bioremediation, using plants to break down toxic remains.\u201d Blais and fellow U of O biologist Christiane Charest began their research on echinacea last summer. \u201cThe results are really promising,\u201d says Blais. \u201cMost of the polluted sites age back to the beginning of the 1900s. Especially around the railroads and the big factories, there the soil is polluted.\u201d Much of the central-west area of Ottawa, including LeBreton Flats and the area around the Chaudi\u00e8re Islands, was covered by factories by the end of the 19th century. The NCC has started to develop a better picture of the number of contaminated sites that they manage and the type of contamination.\u00a0That is why, the federal agency says, it has started the research now. \u201cThe approach is a potential solution that is worth investigating in this context\u201d, says Mario Tremblay, an NCC spokesman. \u201cBecause there were no rules on the dumping of toxic leftovers, these areas are polluted now. The flowers can bring a solution in cleaning these areas\u201d, says George Neville, president of the Historical Society of Ottawa.\u201cBut NCC can\u2019t get rid of the polluted soil,\u201d says Neville. \u201cThey just move it to another site. That is why the flowers are really promising.\u201d The NCC started looking for a natural way to clean up the soil, because moving soil is expensive and finding locations to manage large volumes of soil is a challenge. \u201cWe move soil when it is absolutely necessary,\u201d says Tremblay.\u00a0\u201cWe prefer an in-situ approach as part of this research project.\u201dWhile the research is still in its early stages, Blais says the idea is to test whether \u201cthe flower can take up the polluted soil into the branches. We use fungus to accelerate the process.\u201d The researchers are testing echinacea because it doesn\u2019t require re-planting every year. The work is being done at a test plot on Victoria Island and in a university laboratory.While it appears that the echinacea can be used in the cleaning process, it will take years to clean up everything. The NCC has chosen such a long-term resolution because the process of remediating sites by excavation is expensive and has to be paced through time. \u201cWe have to consider the environmental risk and (funding) availability,\u201d says Tremblay. \u201cThis approach is a solution that needs to be investigated. It is an interesting solution for contaminated sites that we are not planning to remediate in the short-term, but are still considered contaminated.\u201d",

It was a mess: IDs, papers, documents all over the place. Jewels and money were gone including $60 she had in a Buddha statue. Her computer was left untouched, just sitting on her bed.\r\rNguyen\u2019s family owns the Pholicious Vietnamese restaurant, at the corner of Somerset and Booth streets. Her story is just one of several in Ottawa\u2019s Asian restaurant business. Since last November, 19 homes have been invaded and robbed, for a total of more than $1 million in losses, according to the police. The robbers focus on Asian restaurant owners because of their long hours and habit of keeping cash, gold, and jewelry at home, police says.\u201cIt's very rare that we see targeted break-ins like that. Usually when these offences are targeted they are against business and not peoples\u2019 homes,\u201d says Ottawa police Staff Sgt. Kal Ghadban, head of the break-and-enter unit.\u201c(The robbers) are doing a bit of homework on who the person is, when they are home and when they\u2019re not,\u201d he says \u201cWhen they go in there\u2019s a substantial loss so they know ahead of time that this person is likely to have money and jewelry.\u201d Nguyen has the same impression.\u201cWe think we were monitored. They seemed to know exactly when we wouldn\u2019t be home. Because our restaurant is family owned, we leave early in the morning and only come home late at night,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a flashback now, but we think we saw suspicious cars parked in our street before the robbery.\u201d Luckily for the Nguyens, they didn\u2019t keep a lot of cash at home. But they still suffered a substantial loss, she says. One of her friends was not so lucky.\u201cI have a friend, her family lost quite a bit of money. They, like a lot of restaurant people, keep their tip cash at home. They lost around $60,000 in cash,\u201d she says.The material loss was not the only issue for Nguyen.\u201cWhat bothered us the most was that our family was being violated. A stranger came into our house and went through our things,\u201d she says. \u201cFor a week it was really rough, we were very scared.\u201dThe police are still investigating, but they are facing some road blocks, according to Ghadban.See Police on page 2Continued from page 1\u201cWe haven\u2019t had many people come forward with information, if any,\u201d Ghadban says. \u201cWith this many (break-ins) there has to be someone who saw something. That\u2019s the biggest hurdle for us now, to get witnesses. We need for someone to come to us with information.\u201dWhen the break-ins started, the police contacted the Chinatown BIA to help get the word out. However, the BIA decided to stop co-operating after the latest series of break-ins.\u201cLast time when we spoke to the media about this issue, more people were targeted. The BIA will not comment on it,\u201d said a member of the BIA who didn\u2019t want to identify herself.Peter So, chairman of the BIA, and also a victim of a break-in, confirmed the new policy.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to scare people.

Despite establishing its role as a key Centretown institution, the idea of relocating Centre 507 for financial reasons is a possibility. \u201cMoving Centre 507 is one of many options,\u201d says Nancy Desjardins, the church\u2019s office administrator. She adds, however, that \u201cthere are no definite plans to move the centre.\u201dHowever, two committees have been struck in order to discuss ways for the church to ensure its long-term financial stability. The committees are specifically looking into a five-year plan for managing the church, Desjardins says.Centre 507 relies on the City of Ottawa for most of its funding, but also receives financial support from the provincial government and community donations.Other ideas being bounced around include charging honorariums from groups that use the church\u2019s space and asking choirs for donations when they give a concert at Centretown United, Desjardins says.According to Centre 507 board executive member Ross Snyder, officials at the centre have been keeping at watchful eye on the various issues the church has been considering. \u201cObviously, since (Centretown United) is the host of the organization, there\u2019s a lot of interest on what outcome will be,\u201d he says.Snyder insisted that the church and Centre 507 had enjoyed an amicable relationship and is confident that Centretown United would immediately inform the centre on its potential options.Still, Snyder says that Centre 507 is prepared for any plans the church pursues.\u201cOnce they have made their decision, then we will act accordingly,\u201d he says.For Jeff Allen, Centre 507 is more than just a space at Centretown United Church.Allen says he\u2019s been coming to Centre 507 for two years and considers its location to be ideal due to its proximity to the downtown core.Relocation of Centre 507 would create a void for the community and would even prompt people to look at risky ways to receive basic items.\u201cIt would result in probably more people on the street begging for money (and an) increase in crime rate since people would do things illegally for food,\u201d he says.To him, Centre 507 represents a feeling of belonging and a chance to learn from other people with similar circumstances.\u201c(There is) a social aspect in coming here and being able to socialize with people who are in the same social situation,\u201d he says.",

Ottawa\u2019s Better Neighbourhoods program rewarded three small-scale community projects, including RightBike, with $30,000 each for their efforts in making the city a better place to live. The funds will be administered during the year to help the projects grow.RightBike is operated through the Causeway Work Centre. \u00a0It is focused on offering training and employment\u00a0 and other opportunities to some of Ottawa's underprivileged and disabled residents. Don Palmer, executive director at Causeway, says the RightBike effort will rely on widespread adoption of the project.\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to get into four neighbourhoods by the end of December (2014) and set up eight new bike stations,\u201d says Palmer. These stations are pick-up and drop-off points where users can rent and return the bikes, and they\u2019re exploring both private and public locations.\u201cThat\u2019s where we need help from parks and recreation, the city transport department and from the councillors because there\u2019s all kinds of bylaws in terms of city streets and parks,\u201d says Palmer.He notes collaboration with the University of Ottawa as a big potential draw for users. Palmer says this is a realistic goal for RightBike in the near future.\u00a0The fleet is at around 65 bicycles now and Palmer estimates 15 more will be in use soon depending on where they can set up hubs.\u201cHopefully the community in Centretown will respond because that\u2019s one of our major links,\u201d he says.Kitchissippi, Rideau-Vanier and Somerset wards are all targets for expansion in the near future. That would create a much wider area than is covered now. McNabb Park Recreation Centre, Centretown Community Health Centre and CycleSalvation at Bronson and Gladstone avenues, are all potential hub locations within the Centretown area.\u201cThere\u2019s such limited parking in Centretown and such demand for that parking that using this system could be very helpful,\u201d says Somerset Coun. Diane Holmes.\u201cIt allows people to conveniently use bicycles, encourages bicycle use and gets people out of their cars. \"There\u2019ll be a couple stations, I\u2019m hoping, in the Somerset ward this year. It helps with peoples\u2019 health, and it\u2019s such a good program to help with employment,\u201d says Holmes. Holmes was at a meeting with the RightBike organizers on Feb. 10 to begin discussing specifically where the city\u2019s money for the project will go.\u201cAs RightBike grows, which it certainly looks like it will, and as we get bicycles out to more parts of the city, the faster it grows the better,\u201d she says.The pick-up and drop-off points are maintained by staff at the businesses they occupy, so this relies heavily on volunteerism and collaboration, says Shane Norris of RightBike.\u201cThese are just local businesses wanting to do something positive for their community around cycling and they really do help us,\u201d says Norris.Mountain Equipment Co-op, Kunstadt Sports and Cyclelogic are among the partners who have\u00a0 already donated space and time to the program in its first two years of operation.\u201cAs long as there\u2019s interest in the communities to keep the project running, then yeah, it will keep running.\u201dThe program grew from three stations in Westboro and Wellington West in 2012 to seven last year, tripling its ridership, while expanding eastward into the Glebe. A full season of access costs $60, but last year the $5 one-day and $20 three-day passes were more popular. According to a user survey, more than 20 per cent of riders were visitors from outside of Canada. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re trying to address different challenges, both environmental, economic and employment, and cycling seems to be a good conduit to address those issues,\u201d he says.Integration with OC Transpo stations is another viable goal for RightBike\u2019s future. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work at that through the course of the year as well,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cIt\u2019s something we said we wanted to do and the Better Neighbourhood groups are supportive of that.\u201dThe other two recipients of Better Neighbourhood grants were the Bayshore Park Community Garden Working Group, which hopes to build an outdoor community oven, and the Stittsville Rotary Club, which is building a \"Peace Park.\"",

Vetting and approving nomenclature was becoming increasingly difficult, according to the report, due to a previous by-law. Names will no longer be restricted to reflect \u201clocal identity\u201d of the region but rather the history and identity of Canada as a whole.\u201cPresently the bylaw has certain criteria embedded in it,\u201d says Arlene Gr\u00e9goire, the city\u2019s building code services director. \u201cIt says (street names) must make reference to local geography, heroes and history \u2013 this is very restrictive because the city, being the capital, should reflect Canadiana.\u201dTwo bylaws currently regulate city and highway road signage.

Voters could cast their ballot in any ward on these special days, not just at their designated polling station, if council passes the recommnedation on March 26.These advance days would be in addition to the two traditional days of advanced voting.The city hopes the extra days and extended hours at the new advance polls will make it easier for residents to vote.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make the voting process accessible to all, and we feel that by adding more days and removing the restriction of a geographic area, we\u2019ll do that,\u201d says Catherine Bergeron, the city manager of elections.Bergeron says the city isn\u2019t setting any specific goals in regards to increasing voter turnout. The new plan is intended to help to resolve some of the challenges residents face in getting to the polls on election day. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking for additional ways that we can help voters exercise their franchise. Some voters feel it is too restrictive to only be able to vote within their area of jurisdiction,\u201d Bergeron says.The city\u2019s report to the finance and economic development committee discussed other barriers that keep residents from voting. \u201cElectors with disabilities have often expressed a preference for voting on an advance vote day because it is less busy, with less noise and less traffic, than voting day,\u201d the report states. At the March 4 meeting, the finance and economic development committee also heard from three members of a local organization called the City for All Women Initiative.Representatives from CAWI said the extra opportunities to vote will increase accessibility for lower-income residents who may be facing challenges such as transportation or childcare. \u201cLiving in poverty adds so many complications to daily life that they don\u2019t set aside time to think about elections,\u201d said CAWI member Dawn Welch. The only additional expenses will be for ballots and elections staff, Bergeron says. But Bergeron conceded that stocking each voting station with the proper ballots for any resident in the city poses a challenge. The City of Ottawa has 23 wards and since residents won\u2019t be restricted by geographic voting boundaries, each polling station would need to be prepared for all eligible voters on the new advance voting days.\u201cThe challenge, obviously, will be to make sure that each voter receives the proper ballot face. We\u2019re also looking to ensure that all voters vote only once,\u201d says Bergeron.The city will maintain a live, electronic voters list to help things run smoothly at the advance polls. As soon as a resident votes at a polling station, their name would be removed from the list, Bergeron explains.This year\u2019s municipal election is Oct. 27. ",

    "body": "Ottawa residents will finally have a new downtown theatre with the opening of a Cineplex in Lansdowne this year. \r\rWhile many residents may be excited to have new screens within walking distance, it could cause some serious competition for the smaller Mayfair theatre on Bank Street.Cineplex announced on Feb. 24 that they would be opening a technologically advanced multiplex as a part of the redevelopment of Lansdowne Park. Pat Marshall, vice-president of communications for Cineplex, says a new downtown theatre is long overdue in this area. The Lansdowne Cineplex will be equipped with a new surround sound system and 1,700 seats for its 10 screens.The Cineplex will also have three VIP screens to give audience members a different movie watching experience. \u201cThey are for adults only, they have reserved seating, the auditoriums themselves are more intimate, they are probably about 120 to 150 seats,\" says Marshall.\"You also have the ability to have food and drink delivered to your seats before the movie begins.\"The Cineplex will also have a full liquor licence, something that the Mayfair theatre has only been able to acquire for special occasions. Mayfair owner Lee Demarbre says the new cinema will be \u201cunfair\u201d competition for his small theatre. \u201cMost single-screen theatres that are closed in North America are closed because there is a multiplex theatre right beside it, so it\u2019s kind of scary.\u201dThe Cineplex will also be showing movies on their release date, while the Mayfair theatre will have to wait two months to show a movie after it has hit the big screens. \u201cHere is the real test: Will the people on Bank Street wait two months to see a movie like Gravity? Or will they go see it at Lansdowne?\u201d says Demarbre.However, the Mayfair is already starting to ramp up some its programming in anticipation of the new multiplex. On March 28, the theatre will be switching from monthly programming to weekly programming in order to get new films to the theatre faster.The theatre has also added a late afternoon matinee to all of its weekday spots, which allows it to screen three shows a day instead of two. To compete with the Cineplex\u2019s VIP screens, the Mayfair will reapply for a full liquor licence, which would allow them to serve alcohol for every show. In addition to these improvements, the Mayfair still has many loyal customers, says Demarbre. The theatre hosted an Oscar party on March 2 and heard some encouraging words from their audience members. \u201cWe did hear a lot of people say that they were going to keep supporting us and not support Lansdowne,\u201d says Demarbe. \u201cIt was nice to hear.\u201d By Christmas this year, Demarbre says he will have a good idea of where the Mayfair is heading given its new competition.",
