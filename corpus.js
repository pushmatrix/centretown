                "One thing I love about many places in Ottawa is their emphasis on supporting local and showcasing new, innovative dishes that speak volumes as to how beautiful food can really be. In this case, Hooch Bourbon House really takes the cake, or is rather the toast of the town with it’s alluring industrial scene down on Rideau Street near the Byward Market. A few minutes past the Rideau Centre this southern style hot spot is praised for its farm-to-table menu and its seafood raw bar. Walking into the restaurant you are embraced not only by the staff, but by the captivating interior of the space itself. With hand painted murals and an array of knick-knacks on a series of shelves, Hooch keeps the eyes wandering and the mouth watering with its menu.",
                "After careful consideration and all the wonderful things I’ve heard from previous friends and reviews, I decided to order the Chicken and Waffles. Taking the night one step further, I also ordered a tray of six oysters from their raw bar as an appetizer. Now before ordering I like to solidify my decision by getting a second opinion from the staff. I feel it is always a good idea to get their feedback and it tells a lot about a restaurant by seeing the kinds of people they employ. In this case the waitress who waited on my roommate and I was marvellous and very helpful explaining both the menu and how Hooch functioned. Before ordering, we asked her how each item stacked up against one another and after being wishy washing, we finally made our decision.",
                "Raw Oysters",
                "In my food adventures there is always room for more ‘firsts’; this time it was trying raw oysters. Nerve racking and excited, my roommate and were craving some morsels from the deep and decided we would try our tastebuds with the raw oysters. Coming out on a bed of ice, we were served three pairs of pre-shucked oysters, all coming from different provinces of Canada. Pardon if I name them wrong, but the server told us we were trying ‘cook’ oysters from PEI, Trump Cups from Nova Scotia, La Bays from New Brunswick. On a side tray was a series of sauces ranging from a big bottle of spicy sriracha to a house bourbon seasoning. Experimenting and topping each oyster off with a combination of flavours enhanced both the experience as well as the appetizer. Now if you’re an adventurer like myself and do not mind weird consistencies in your mouth, then I would highly suggest trying these out. The oysters mixed with a condiment or two made the dish slimy and satisfying! However, although there was a bit of sand in one of mine, the whole experience of giving these a try was worth it, and I am most certainly getting these again soon!",
                "Chicken and Waffles",
                "I can see why people were raving about this dish in many of the reviews I had read, because oh my gosh it was amazing! Now, I always love taking home leftovers but as the waitress suggested my roommate and I should order the half size portion of the meal rather than the full size. I couldn’t thank her enough because I still got to take leftovers home and enjoy an amazing meal! Watching as my plate was set down in front of me, this beautifully fried cornish hen was laying on top of a fluffy buttermilk waffle. Drenched in a chipotle maple emulsion, each bite hits your tastebuds with a note of heat and sweet leaving you wanting more. The skin on the outside of the cornish hen was perfectly crisp and when biting into it, your mouth is taken on a journey. First is the seductive crunch, up next comes the juicy tenderness from the fried portion, and finally you get an amazing explosion of flavour that gives highlights of both soul and southern. The creation and execution of this plate is one to be proud of, and I can see how it has come to be one of Hooch Bourbon House’s signature dishes. If you’ve never had chicken and waffles before, I highly recommend giving them a try; furthermore, I highly suggest you try the ones from Hooch Bourbon House for they are superb.",
                "All in all, my experience at this restaurant was top notch; the service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and it is a really cool place to check out if you’re in the area. It was a Tuesday when I went, so I might have to come back on the weekend and give their infamous bourbon menu a try!"

                "They might need to change their name to ‘Oh So Fantastically Delicious’ because this place was awesome! Sitting in the Byward Market on York street lies Oh So Good Desserts and Coffee House, with goodies and warm drinks all around. Walking in, our first reaction was ‘wow, look how big this place is’. From the outside it looks itty bitty, but just opening the door, the place stretches quite far leaving lots of room to sit and enjoy some great desserts. Also, the decor of the place is really neat; not only is there a super cool mural on the wall, but like many places in Ottawa, they were displaying art made by a local artist that you can buy. Thus, the art is continuously changing to create a different experience every time.",
                "Now, ordering what you want is probably one of the more difficult things to do because there are so many different kinds of cakes, squares, pies…literally every dessert under the sun you could imagine. After trailing along the display case like a hungry school of fish, we finally made up our minds and ordered two pieces of cake.",
                "Carmel Pecan Cheesecake Served with a light, airy whipped cream this dessert was a knock out of the park and definitely an Oh So Good moment. Starting from the bottom, there was a perfectly baked layer of graham cracker crust that crumbled oh so perfectly with every forkful. In the middle was a super rich cheesecake that melted in your mouth. The cheesecake was crowned with pecans and a dreamy carmel and chocolate sauce. Together each element of this cheesecake worked so perfectly. The texture was brilliant and it is without a doubt one of the best cheesecakes I’ve had in a while. Just a tip though, if you’re going to go with the cheesecake do go at it alone! Find yourself a fork friend or you might be finding yourself getting it wrapped to go…but then again that’s not always a bad thing right?",
                "Chocolate Raspberry Cake The Chocolate Raspberry cake was one that Brianne ordered and again it was plated with a fresh whipped cream, chocolate and raspberry sauce. The cake was topped with a delectably thick chocolate frosting that brought joy to ones tastebuds in every forkful. With a silky chocolate ganache, whipped cream, and hints of raspberry between each layer, this dessert was well put together. The cake itself was super moist, very rich in chocolate flavours and mouthwatering with every bite. The only critic would be to have fresh raspberries on the plate as well with the sauces on the side; it would put this dish over the top.",
                "All in all, I need to head back to Oh So Good because not only is their selection massive for desserts, but this place will literally hit your sweet spot. The service is quick, and you have to order and pay before you get your delicious desserts. Make yourself feel good in all the right places and go to Oh So Good! Another tip: bring your significant other, they will tell all their friends you are the most romantic and best partner ever!"

                "The first time I went to this underground industrial establishment, I was deeply disappointed only because it was so popular I wasn’t able to get in! Now although they do have a wait list, I didn’t really want to wait around on Elgin for their two hour wait time. However, the second time was that of victory (maybe because we showed up right when it opened), nonetheless we got in! Soon the place was abuzz with bar-sitters, first-daters, long-time lovers and well, us. We were greeted and seated by a lovely fellow, who didn’t offer us the most help, but he was very nice and prompt with taking our order. We started our grand meal off by ordering an appetizer to tickle the tastebuds, so we ordered the chips with the fresh guacamole. Now, since we had chosen our ‘app’ it was time to choose a drink, and what goes better with tacos than tequila! More specifically, their 3oz’er Margarita (yes please). After we got our drinks and app ordered we began to peruse the rest of the menu for a few moments until deciding what we wanted to order. Looking at all the various different tacos to choose from, I had a hard time narrowing my choices down. In the end I had to get at least three of these beauties so I ordered: one ox tongue, one fish, and one vegetarian. Side-note: If you’re a vegetarian and don’t see any veggie tacos on the menu no worries! You can ask the waiters/waitresses for them, they for some reason just do not include them on there! Alright, now let’s explore how amazing both the drinks and food was further, shall we? The Drink",
                "Margarita In a short, cylindrical glass came this mighty 3oz Margarita in all its glory. Rimmed with salt, this deliciously refreshing drink was a great balance of flavours that was not too over powering. Topped off with fresh lemon and lime zest, this drink was invigorating and stimulating on the tongue and with every sip, I was brought right back to the summer sun. If tequila is your thing I would highly suggest it, it was a wonderful pairing with the meal we had! The Appetizer Guacamole Served with a heap of fresh, crispy tortilla chips was an amazingly smooth and creamy bowl of delicious guacamole. Taking that first dip into the basin of green goodness your mouth is hit with the richness of the avocado and medley of fresh tomatoes and cilantro. The cilantro was key in marrying each element in the bowl; its crisp, herbal notes helped these flavours to meld together in harmony to create something magical. However, I cannot forget the strong hit of jalapeño you get when finishing off your bite. This shot of heat is in no way overbearing but rather helps to amalgamate the ingredients, creating a wonderfully balanced appetizer. The Main Served on two separate plates, the dishes were served in a ‘sharing’ ‘family-style’ way where both myself and my two friends just grabbed our tacos from each plate and chowed down. Taking time to snap a few quick shots before our jowls could not bare to stare any longer, this is what I thought about each of them! Ox Tongue Taco This taco really had me excited even before I arrived at the establishment for I’ve never had ox tongue before; it always makes for a more fun experience when \"firsts” are involved. Now the really awesome thing about each taco is that they are all served on house made tortillas, making the experience even more authentic and compelling. At first glance, each taco looked phenomenal, getting the the first bite in made it all the more spectacular. The first bite into the ox tongue my hand was dripping with juicy taco deliciousness. The ox tongue had a great barbecue char taste and once mixed with avacado, shaved radish, fresh cilantro, and a kick of heat from the jalapeños, this one definitely set the bar high for the rest of the other tacos. Crispy Fish Taco Covered with the same fresh vegetables this tempura battered piece of fish was very well done. The jalapeños, cilantro, and avocado once again merged together fantastically! However, it also topped with a spicy mayo with fresh slaw underneath the fish. With a bit of crunch, the tempura batter had a delectable coating around the fish, and the fish itself had a nice savoury flavour that made you want a whole plate full. Although may of the elements on the taco were the same, the added spicy mayo and fresh slaw really made this dish stand out and validated it as its own kind of taco. Vegetarian Taco Finally, the veggie taco! Now, I always like try both sides of the food spectrum whether it be a carnivorous plate or a herbivorous one and I usually find either/or make for great decisions. When first ordering this taco our waiter let us know that instead of fish, they batter and fry a piece of eggplant in its place. For this taco they use the same toppings as the fish taco—fresh slaw, avocado, jalapeños, and cilantro with a small hit of spicy mayo. I have, once again, never had tempura battered eggplant and to my surprise it was really good that I might even have to put it above the fish taco. The eggplant was crispy on the outside with a nicely cooked inside, and with the assortment of the other vegetables it make this dish both spicy and savoury with each bite. After coming to El Camino I would hugely recommend giving it a try! The place is super cool with an awesome atmosphere and clearly they are doing something right with all the prodigious food they’re serving up! I really enjoyed the freshness of both their style of restaurant and food itself; this kind of establishment clearly prides themselves on passion and it shines in each plate they serve. My advice: they unfortunately do not take reservations, so try and get there at opening. The place isn’t very big, thus it gets busy very quickly and it is hard to get a seat unless you’d like to stick around for a two hour wait list!"

                "Things to try: Savoury Panwiches and everything else that is buttermilky goodness",
                "Tucked away on Bank Street is the sugar shack inspired flapjacks flipping food truck that is giving people a new perspective on pancakes. Now, for all of you out there who are scared to embrace the food truck culture, or have never had a chance to, today is a new day! Flapjack’s Pancake Shack is an interesting little spot that sits among condos, restaurants, and urban street art that decorates its ally wall. Walking off the main drag, I entered an entirely different realm of the city. With their solid stump seats and wooden picnic tables, Flapjack’s has transformed this little courtyard to encapsulate the very rustic, backwoods of Canada feel. Furthermore, on top of their picturesque atmosphere, I need to give kudos to the amazing food that’s flying out of their truck window. If you didn’t know, Flapjack’s is making some of the best pancakes in the city and has changed the way breakfast is being served. On their menu, a customer can choose between several options to make personalized, customized stacks of buttermilk goodness. However, for me personally, I like to try the items that have been put together purposely by the chefs themselves. In this way, I get to understand what works when melded between two delicious pancakes and why people come back for more! After going not once, but twice in a row, I ordered myself two of the different ‘panwiches’ and was successfully satisfied! The JIMBERRR! Watson Starting off this fantastic food adventure I wanted to try something savoury, and anything in sandwich form is a thumbs up for me. Getting up to the menu I immediately start sifting through the panwiches—landing my eye on the first one. With double smoked bacon, gouda cheese, and an egg nestled between two original buttermilk pancakes, this sounded like something I had to devour. After about a 6 minute wait, the window slid open and the order was up. I grabbed my little white box with great anticipation, sat down on a tree stump chair and opened it up. Taking the first bite was exceptional! The two buttermilk pancakes were cooked to a perfect golden brown and worked surprisingly well as ‘bread’. The egg was still a tiny bit running inside, which was superb, and the double smoked bacon was crispy but not overdone. The gouda cheese was the pièce de résistance, adding a that last bit of melted savoury goodness creating a well balanced sandwich. Mixing each element—the egg, cheese, and bacon on two fluffy, hot buttermilky pancakes just made my mouth water and want more. The sandwich overall was not as big as I thought it was going to be, but it was the perfect size. Anything bigger could potentially be a big floppy pancake mess. The Campfire Coming back the next day I thought I’d give the sweeter side of Flapjack’s panwiches a go. This time I chose to order the ‘Campfire’ which consisted of mini marshmallows and Nutella between two graham cracker pancakes. Now, I was not as impressed with this one as I was with the first, but it was still pretty awesome. The graham cracker pancakes were great, they were piping hot and uber fluffy. What had fallen short for me personally was the graham cracker flavour; it was hard find the great honey baked essence that is a graham cracker. Also, the marshmallows and nutella were just globbed in the middle and not evenly spread throughout…but I guess you could say I saved the best for last! It was great to get sticky and messy with food once in a while (in the best way possible of course). The whole excursion was a memorable one. From the rustic furniture in the great outdoors to the hands on experience you face when chowing down on Flapjack’s finest. I thought the concept was immensely unique and the food was phenomenal. I would also highly recommend this to everyone with two feet and a heartbeat looking for a fantastic new place to try! Rain, sleet, snow or hail these boys are killing it with pancakes!"

For my 22nd birthday my brother decided to treat me to some great eats, and thus we decided to come to this gem on Preston.

                "Cheese Board Starting our night off we ordered a Cheese Board, because of course me being me I love and need my fill of delicious cheese! On the board were several different things that added to the character of the cheese, amplifying character to each bite. These extra bits consisted of coffee figs, fig jam, pressed olives, and house made charcuterie—german sausage, duck prosciutto, and salami. Also on the board there were three cheeses: organic gouda cheese, blue cheese, and a double cream brie. The organic gouda was simply delightful, it was firm yet very creamy and had a great distinct flavour that made your mouth want more. Next was the blue cheese; I’m not the biggest fan of this kind of cheese because many people give it a bad wrap, but all in all it wasn’t as bad as i thought it would be. Although the cheese had a powerful punch at the end, it was a very good when paired with other elements on the plate. Lastly was the double creamed brie from Quebec, and as always I loved every little bit of it. Spreading the brie onto a crispy piece of crostini and taking a bite, it was smooth, luscious, and so creamy you couldn’t help but wish you had more. After adding a few of the other components to it, such as a dab of fig jam and a slice of duck prosciutto, the mix of sweet and salty created a delicious combination of flavour. The only problem we had with this dish was that for the price there should have been more than one piece of each cheese, or should have been a lower price.",
                "Sandwich Special Going for something different, my brother decided to try the special of the night and ordered the baby ham sandwich. Set on fresh ciabatta bread, this sandwich consisted of baby hamlet, fresh fennel salad, with some pickled porketa, pickled eggplant, oven dried tomato, and a slice of gouda cheese. It also came with a delicious pile of fresh cut french fries and a spicy house mayo dip. Overall, the sandwich was a bit of a disappointment though. When biting into it, you get lost in a mouthful of tomato and the flavours of the hamlet and pickled porketa disappear. After pulling the tomato off, the taste was still quite overbearing, making the rest of the sandwich not as enjoyable as it could have been. It was an interesting concept and the combination of these flavours sounded really good, but once they are put altogether it was definitely a let down. The fries and mayo dip on the other hand was delicious, but maybe try asking for no salt on them they had just a tad too much on them.",
                "Scallops Wow, wow, wow. That’s all I would like to say about this dish, but I think my readers may need more than that. After being served this aesthetically eye pleasing dish, my mouth began to salivate in anticipation to bite into the succulent scallops upon this plate. Now, before I ordered this dish I was a bit hesitant only because it came with brussels sprouts, but after asking the waiter about it he assured me that it was very good, and thus my decision was made. On the plate before me lie beautifully seared scallops atop crispy brussels sprouts with a hint of citrus in with each bite. Sprinkled on top were some lovely watercress, thick pieces of their house bacon, some brandy soaked golden raisins, pumpkin seeds with a sunchoke puree underneath. I am not kidding one little bit when I say this dish was an amazing choice. The scallops were stunningly cooked to perfection, and with every element on the plate there was an amazing diversity of flavours and texture that complimented one another. Side note—my brother is also not a big fan of brussels sprouts, so he didn’t really like it as much, however I don’t like them either. These ones were hard not to love though, they had a fabulous crispy shell and a citrusy flavour that made them that much more appetizing!",

Plus, now I can officially say I’ve gone to a restaurant and ordered one of everything off the menu! It was amazing.",

                "As one night ended at Two Six {Ate} another one just happened to begin as we ran into and joined a table of my brothers’ friends at MeNa. New to the Little Italy strip, this place was clean cut with slick hardwood floors accompanied by modern industrial light fixtures. With a nice big front window, this place looked just as good from the outside as it did from the inside. Walking inside, we joined another table together with the others, sat down and were quickly taken care of as we were added to the food party.",
                "The staff was friendly, very professional, and well put together for being only a few days since its opening. After ordering myself one of there suggested cocktails, we began to chat amongst ourselves as we soaked in the intimate incandesce of the vintage ceiling lights. The design of the restaurant was well laid out and before long our first appetizers had arrived. In this review, I will highlight my most favourite and definitely suggest you try it for yourself!",

                "Baked Potato Soup I feel there should have been that angelic sound play as this bowl of heaven was served, for it was an extraordinary dish. I know, it is a bowl of soup…but what a bowl of soup it was! Now, this was not only great choose as starter because soup is always a great choice, but because the textures and flavours melded together very well. I was amazed that the crispiness of the baked potato skins in the soup were still crispy when I had taken a bite. Needless to say I was astounded. It was not a mushy piece of potato, but rather it had a brittle and crunchy skin that was enveloped in a creamy garlic chive base for the soup. Incorporating big hearty portions for potato with braised leek, this soup was a fantastic starter to a wonderful meal to come.",

                "Roasted Chicken Breast Laying on a bed of sautéed was beautifully cooked, sliced and served piece of chicken. Taking the first bite, moist. Taking the second bite, I just want more. When it was mixed with the smaller components on the plate; the sweet and sour onions, and sautéed cabbage all of the flavours worked together fabulously. The chicken brought a great dynamism to both the plate and my palate, satisfying every inch of my tastebuds. If this wasn’t enough, there was a lovely, aromatic coquette that was bursting with deliciousness. I very much enjoyed this dish and cannot wait to go back to see what else they have in store.",

                "Chocolate & Pistachio As this dessert was placed onto the table, my eyes widened and my fork rose to shallow white bowl to snag a piece of this tower of decadent excellence. Sitting centre stage was a beautifully plated chocolate Mousse, with a deliciously thick layer of chocolate ganache. To compliment both of these elements was a stunningly creamy pistachio ice-cream that was refreshingly light. To finish it all off was a fabulous little kumquat that was also filled with the airy, rich chocolate mousse. All-in-all this was a great dish from start to finish, and you know if I could…I probably would have licked the plate.",

Putting my bold, foodie foot forward I decided I'd order the catfish as my main, and I was pleasantly surprised Coated in a Ritz cracker crust with a pecan pureé and topped off with wilted frisee and lemon, this dish was a win. The fish was beautifully seared, with a nice crispy texture on the outside and flaky and moist inside.
